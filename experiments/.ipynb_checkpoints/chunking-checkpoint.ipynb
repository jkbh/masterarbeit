      "level9\t ------------------Books have long been used in a wide variety of performances in many cultures, ranging from religious rituals to scholarly practices and from courtly etiquette to theatre performances. They contain and preserve instructions about the perfor-mances, covering utterances, movements and actions. They are interacted with by human actors as part of the performance, and sometimes they themselves are the centre of performances. Books of this kind were handwritten for centuries – indeed, for millennia in some cultures. Even in the era of the printed book and our current digital era, handwritten or hand-annotated books still continue to play an important role in many kinds of performances, allowing individualised solutions to be found for keeping records and transmitting information. This volume presents a collection of papers by experts from a wide variety of disciplines, each with their own methods and approaches. Together, they offer a panorama of perspectives on how manuscripts can be studied as objects and actors in various kinds of performances. Situated at the juncture between manuscript studies and performance studies, they analyse the various roles that manuscripts play in a broad range of performances in different religions, arts and sciences. They consider situations where humans, manuscripts and other kinds of natural or supernatural entities interact. While some of the contribu-tions focusing on contemporary manuscripts rely on the authors’ direct observa-tions, all of the papers analyse the performances in which manuscripts are in-volved from the material, textual and visual evidence provided by the manuscripts themselves. The manuscripts studied here are shaped by the performances in which they participate, while also shaping the performances in which they are in-volved. Developing tools on a case-study basis in order to unravel, explore and study the complex relationships between manuscripts and performances is the central purpose of this volume. In order to enter this largely unchartered territo-ry, rather than prescribing a rigid theoretical and methodological framework to follow, we invited the authors to use their own expertise and methodological toolkits to propose a suitable approach to the specific challenges posed by the manuscripts and their religious, artistic or scientific domains. Thus, each chap-\n",

In addition to the specific new research re-sults outlined in each article, it is this diversity of concrete methodological propositions presented by authors from a wide range of scholarly disciplines that is the strength of this collective volume. To start off, it may be useful to provide a rough sketch of how ‘performance’ is generally conceived of in the various papers that weave manuscript and per-formance studies together. We take it that in a performance, the performers engage in a planned and intentional series of actions that are meant to have a particular effect on the audience. This description contains three key expres-sions that we shall simply touch on initially. First, our understanding of per-formers is very broad and includes individuals, groups and objects. Groups can either act in synchrony, such as when a group of singers perform a song togeth-er on stage, or in diachrony when the ‘same’ musical piece is performed in a community, for instance – perhaps in a ritual context – over the course of gen-erations or when a standard astronomical observation programme is conducted for centuries and stored in a dedicated archive by the astronomers. Objects of many kinds can play a crucial role in performances, so much so that they them-selves can be regarded as performers. They may be ‘natural’ sites, buildings, altars, different kinds of instruments or, of course, manuscripts. Second, these different networks of performers engage in a series of actions that is often re-garded as the performance itself. By using the word ‘planned’ here, we are at-tempting to express the essential fact that the series of actions must be per-ceived as being deliberate by the performers (and generally the audience as well), and not just as something random. Moreover, the planning of perfor-mances also involves temporality and spatialisation. Finally, audiences are also understood in a highly inclusive way: they include both the performers and any witnesses of the phenomena produced during the performance who are able and willing to give a meaning to these phenomena. A performance is a communicative act, regardless of whether it is planned or spontaneous, conducted orally or done in writing. Generally, this kind of communication is conceived of as existing in performance only, that is, de-ployed instantaneously during the performance. However, the temporality of a performance covers a larger array of implications and possibilities. When broad-ly considering a performance as an action, it includes a certain degree of prepa-ration, practice and iterations preceding its concrete realisation. Similarly, once the action itself is accomplished, its recording and transmission may also be considered an integral part of the performance. These periods of time preceding \n",

Consequently, we regard the different stages of the construction and rendition of a performance as an integral part of the performative process. In addition, this volume of SMC seeks to highlight the different processes at the heart of the performance leading to the creation of performative rules or customs, and to explore the resulting appropriation and adaptation of the per-formance in various cultural and social settings. In this context, there is no tension between the singular and collective endeavours taking part in the act of performance, but a complementarity over time. The medium or the channel of the textualisation and transmission of the performance – the manuscript – may also be seen as a vehicle of memorisation. In some cases, the techniques and principles of memorisation may become a performance per se, as in the example of the medieval ars memoriae (‘art of memory’). The contributions to the volume follow different approaches, ranging from codicological, philological and art-history methodologies to more ethnograph-ical ones based on direct observations. In most cases, they are attempts to use various means to re-enact or reconstruct the performance in which manuscripts are involved as a way to inspect and study the relationship between manu-scripts and their performance. This sheds a particular light on the material, visual and intellectual aspects of manuscripts and reconfigures the view on these aspects and their mutual relations. Consequently, the papers reveal the ways in which manuscripts were produced and used, and how they functioned in the environment in which they circulated. The ‘performing’ look at manuscript studies adopted in this book opens up a perspective where the relation between manuscripts, the practices that shape them, and related networks of individuals, groups and objects is the central focus. The issues of temporality and spatialisation also come to the fore in ana-lysing the manuscripts themselves and the performances in which they play a role. For instance, the timing and spatial arrangement of a performance can be found in a manuscript. Some books contain information about when the per-formance takes place, how long certain actions last or where the performers, audience and objects should be and at what distance from each other. At the same time, details about time and space that are not recorded in manuscripts or known to us can be reconstructed by participating in or observing the perfor-mances. Conversely, the collection of case studies presented here also reflects views that will no doubt enrich performance studies. First, it does so in a temporal dimension by revealing ways and methods that allow performances to be recon-\n",

We hope that our book will be used as a kind of repository of propositions for different approaches that allow the history of different types of performance practices to be explored in systematic ways. Second, the scope of what is usually considered in performance studies has been broadened here to include various textual and artistic practices as well as scientific and religious endeavours. In some ways, this broadening of such a wide range of socially embedded creative practices under the umbrella term of ‘performance’ produces a manuscript-sources-based platform suitable for further anthropological and philosophical research on the significance of these practices for various local cultures. In light of this, we have chosen to organise the contents of the book accord-ing to three different ways in which manuscripts function in relation to a partic-ular form of performance. The papers in the first section, ‘Manuscripts for per-formance’, discuss manuscripts that are used backstage for preparing and giving instructions for performances. The second section, ‘Manuscripts in per-formance’, presents manuscripts that are taken on stage, as it were, contrib-uting to the enactment of performances. Finally, the last section, ‘Manuscripts as performers’, is on manuscripts that are performers in their own right, produc-ing a desired effect on the audience. \n",
      "level4\t --------2 Manuscripts for performance \n",
      "level9\t ------------------A manuscript may be defined as one of the channels of communication that allow a user to prepare a performance or record it once it is finished. In this sense, the medium is the textualisation of the future or past performance. If the performance covers various cultural practices, it also implies a large number of different textual and writing practices. Taking this idea a step further, authors, scribes or readers can be considered performers of a book or a page.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------1\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The manu-script per se is difficult to assess as an instrument of performance; it is only when it is linked with the action of performance that it can be defined as such. It is certainly clearer when a manuscript was used to prepare a forthcoming per-formance – it could be a set of instructions or stipulated actions for the purpose of the performance. This is particularly striking in the case of medical recipes or religious rituals.\n",

These instructions are written either as simple memoranda listing the different stages of the performance or as canonical rules to be fol-lowed to the letter. The mise à l’écrit of some words is also justified by their illocutionary force.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------3\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The power conveyed by the writing and oral pronunciation of the utterance or word should not be underestimated. The written expression of the preparation of the performance also covers a large spectrum of practices, from musical notation, indications when to read a text, écrits opportunistes (‘opportunistic writings’), informal writing and marginalia to formalised, com-missioned texts.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------4\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The narrative structure can also vary in accordance with inno-vations introduced by the scribes, which reflect changes in the performance practices, or those required by an institution or the manuscript’s commissioner. However, the structure also varies in relation to the different practices found in the geographical area in question, the identity of the owner and the reader, and various other factors. These writings are therefore rarely fixed. On the contrary, they are subject to the hazards experienced by their containers. A manuscript was often passed from hand to hand, texts were amended and notes were made near them. If a text was written in anticipation of its performance, its textualisation also guar-anteed its survival after the performance and made it available for changes or a different audience. Instead of fixity, the textualisation of the performance-to-be enabled its adaptability in future. This adaptability implies different practices and modes of circulation: the text may have been circulated as part of a textual tradition – with all that that implied regarding variations and changes – or it served as the basis for a new performance. In any event, texts and manuscripts of this kind were produced for the purpose of being performed in the first in-stance. A manuscript can also preserve texts that testify to past performances. This sometimes happened when an existing text was amended after a perfor-mance to improve the set of instructions for the next performance. The practice is particularly common in scientific observations and experiments as part of the performative action, permitting one to enhance and enrich a set of instructions. As a matter of fact, despite their repetitive dimension, most of these rules, in-structions and memoranda were regarded as temporary and adaptable by con-temporary users. The entanglement between the individual and collective traditions of the texts and manuscripts is also worth underlining. An individual can make a writ-\n",

This record may then become an exemplar used by different groups as a result of its transmission. Furthermore, in Christianity, for instance, manuscripts with re-cordings or instructions about rituals were made to be diffused for communal use, either at a specific time or over several generations. This temporal dimen-sion seems twofold: it includes a practical aspect – the fact of memorising the instructions to be performed – and an ontological aspect drawing upon the idea of transmitting information to future generations. The latter is linked to the inextricable relationship between a book and memoria (‘memory’), a trope used by many authors and scholars over the years. Through the writing process, knowledge about performances is transmitted for the future and may even be-come a collective cultural asset at one point. The adaptivity of the instructions or rules relating to a performance also leads to successive written additions being made, resulting in several layers of practices and memoria accumulating over time. It is not unusual to find a series of predictions written in a manuscript at different times.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------5\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ As the memorial channel of a performance, a manuscript is certainly more striking when the performative act is shaped by a community or is the result of a collective practice. Unlike a single memory transmitted to a group, this is a col-lective practice or performance established as a rule and then appropriated by one or more individuals. The Latin term canon clearly states this kind of trans-mission; it refers to a custom, a rule or a set of instructions continuously adapted to different needs, uses or societies. The performance originating from an original collective endeavour laid the foundations for single or collective reworkings and appropriation in the future. No matter whether they are liturgi-cal, astronomical, arithmetical, religious or scientific canons, they clearly re-flect this process of creation and perpetual adaptation to different realities and different times. Manuscripts are considered to be a medium of performance by Alexander Weinstock and Martin Jörg Schäfer in their paper dedicated to German prompt books of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. These books detail theat-rical performances and were intended to standardise and diffuse them. Alt-hough prompt books were produced to set a performance on paper, they were constantly adapted to the context of a specific theatre. Each prompt book is therefore unique, displays a great variety of practices and mentions different people. These manuscripts are significant evidence of the different aspects of a \n",

A manu-script of this kind which is produced communally prepares and shapes the col-lective performance. Two different aspects of the temporality of a performance are highlighted by Mathieu Ossendrijver in his article on Babylonian and Assyrian sources pro-duced during the first millennium \n",
      "level10\t --------------------BCE\n",
      "level9\t ------------------. Babylonian sources have preserved in-formation about the preparation and recording of the performance and some-times include predictions and observations. The performance per se is not explained in astronomical diaries produced by Babylonian astronomers, contra-ry to Assyrian letters and reports revealing a great deal of information about performative rituals, observations and interpretation of the performance. The two types of sources are compared in terms of their underlying similarities, but the author also points out their differences in terms of how the performance was prepared and recorded and in terms of their performative processes. The close link that exists between liturgy and private devotion is analysed by Eva Ferro. Her examination of the contents, format and visual organisation of a late-fifteenth-century breviary from the Abbey of San Zeno in Verona, Italy (Kremsmünster, Stiftsbibliothek, CC60) leads her to the conclusion that alt-hough the manuscript contains texts that were needed for the collective celebra-tion of the liturgy, it was probably made for the abbot’s personal use rather than for the monastic community’s collective ritual practices. Thus, this manuscript reflects the simultaneous existence of a collective and individual performance. Focusing on multiplication procedures in mathematical commentaries in Sanskrit, Agathe Keller explores the way in which a common mathematical operation was performed and then recorded to transmit and standardise a prac-tice. Lists of solutions to mathematical problems contained in the commentaries she studies reveal a wealth of information about the material surface on which the operations or mathematical diagrams were originally performed or drawn. This article also testifies to the constant adaptability of the performance and its execution. The text was not fixed, but remained open to changes in terms of procedures. The generic aspect of the commentaries opens the way to many individual interpretations. The appropriation of different sources originating from or shaping a per-formance and the production of new instructions and rules to perform are ex-plored by Laure Miolo in her article about astronomer Lewis Caerleon’s note-book. The temporality of the notebook, which was produced in the fifteenth century, is investigated here. The little book reveals an astronomical agenda devoted to eclipse computations. The different stages of Lewis Caerleon’s learn-ing of computational procedures highlight his scientific training based on the \n",

His observations are also recorded, but more as a means to legitimate computa-tional practices than for the observational performance per se. \n",
      "level4\t --------3 Manuscripts in performance \n",
      "level9\t ------------------While manuscripts can play an essential role in preparing a performance, they are often essential to the performances themselves as well, regardless of wheth-er these are religious rituals, musical or theatrical performances, scholarly re-search or teaching. Direct, multi-sensory interaction with the manuscripts is an essential part of performing with them: manuscripts are touched and handled, they are looked at, read and their contents are often vocalised (read out loud, chanted or sung). The ways in which manuscripts are part of the performance vary, as does the way in which they are embedded in their specific spatial and temporal settings. Perhaps the most obvious of these is that books are read from in many oral performances, whether during the Christian liturgy, a Buddhist monk’s sermon, a musical performance or individual prayer. While the performer(s) will sometimes only rely on manuscripts as a back-up aide-mémoire, some ritual performances such as the celebration of the Eu-charist require the performer – in this case the priest-celebrant – to read every single word from the book, however familiar the wording may already be to that person. In addition to the words to be read and/or spoken by the performer, many other instructions about individual elements or the overall structure of the performance are present in manuscripts, too. These include musical nota-tion, recitation marks and vocalisation aids instructing the performer about what words to use and how to pronounce, chant or sing them. Manuscripts made for complex performances that consist of a series of different readings and other actions may provide a structure for them by the manner in which their contents or paratextual elements are ordered. It is important to note, however, that the reading of linear texts is not the only way in which manuscripts can be used as tools for performance. Engaging with multi-graphic configurations such as tables and diagrams, maps and choreographic notation, for instance, calls for very different performative approaches. While performances are shaped by manuscripts, manuscripts are also shaped by the performances for which they are used: from the choice and order of their contents to their visual organisation and material form. The second part of this volume contains five contributions that analyse the processes in which \n",

      "level9\t ------------------performances and manuscripts shape each other. They all have a strong focus on the material and visual evidence of manuscripts, while also considering how these objects were embedded in the performance spatially and temporally. Karen Desmond focuses on manuscripts used by singers in thirteenth-century England that are quite unlike the codices in which most medieval music has been transmitted to us: not the codex, but rather the scroll met these per-formers’ requirements, and experimental approaches to the visual organisation and later additions and modifications testify to the performers’ ongoing creative and pragmatic engagement with these manuscripts. Matthieu Husson and Samuel Gessner’s article investigates the ways in which a manuscript could be used for astronomical computation. The authors conclude that the physical handling of the manuscript, in particular the intense engagement with the tables and diagrams that are part of this highly sophisti-cated scholarly tool, shaped the user’s understanding of the astrological phe-nomena investigated, highlighting both the potential and the limitations of such an approach. Three articles are dedicated to the roles of manuscripts in religious perfor-mances. Jochen H. Vennebusch looks for evidence of how the staggering num-ber of gospel books and gospel lectionaries that are known to have been part of the treasury of Bamberg Cathedral at the time of its foundation may have been ‘orchestrated’ throughout the year and within the topography of the cathedral. Lacking contemporary descriptions or instructions regarding this, the author focuses on passages in the manuscripts that are highlighted in various ways, both those that are part of the original commission and those that were added later to books that were initially produced for other churches. Karin Becker’s detailed analysis of the visual organisation of medieval psal-ter manuscripts in relation to their use for celebrating the Divine Office reveals the difficult relationship between the demands of a complex series of liturgical performances and the wish to preserve the Psalms in their entirety and in the original biblical order. The result of this is intricately structured and visually sophisticated manuscripts whose correct use, however, requires extensive knowledge of the structure and elements of the Divine Office, which is not ex-plained in the manuscripts themselves. Frequent additions indicate that later users tried to include more instructions and structuring aids in the manuscripts. Silpsupa Jaengsawang’s contribution to the volume focuses on more recent manuscripts used in Buddhist funerary rituals in Laos and Thailand. In a ritual of this kind, a monk gives a sermon to an audience by relying on specific manu-scripts. The article analyses the production of such manuscripts, their dedica-tion to a particular monastery and their circulation in order to reveal their role \n",

Part of an ongoing tradition, these manuscripts com-bine conservative characteristics like the oblong shape of the ‘pothi’ (palm-leaf manuscript), regardless of the actual material the manuscript is made of, with adaptations to the changing habits and skills of the producers and monks who perform with them. \n",
      "level4\t --------4 Manuscripts as performers \n",
      "level9\t ------------------Manuscripts can be essential for performance ‘behind’ or ‘on’ the stage, as the two previous sections show. In some instances, they can be regarded as per-formers in themselves. This corresponds to situations where the reading, han-dling, display or even production of manuscripts during a performance makes them the direct protagonists of the performance and not simply a medium to be used for or during the performance. In these contexts, the different layers of the complex relations between the actions of the performances and the textual, pictorial and material characteristics of the manuscripts interact more sharply. The temporality embedded in the manuscripts, their multi-sensorial physical presence and the effect that this presence has on the audience, the ways manu-scripts organise the knowledge they transmit diachronically and synchronical-ly, and the role of the individuals involved in their production, circulation and use are all aspects that are connected in various ways and that make the manu-scripts powerful representatives of their contents and the knowledge that their commissioners possessed. The articles in the third and last part of the volume reveal the interplay that exists between content, materiality, use and function in manuscripts by consid-ering them as the main actors in a ‘network’ of performances. As such, manu-scripts may ‘perform authorisation’: they have an authorising role to play by testifying and sanctioning the sacrality of the texts and images they transmit and legitimising their circulation. Besides authorisation, manuscripts may ‘per-form authority’ as well: they have an authoritative role of witnessing royal polit-ical power or, when displayed (in a church, for example), ensuring the correct-ness of the performances as a kind of ‘judge’. Manuscripts may also ‘perform stability’: they ensure the stability or ‘purity’ of traditions over the centuries and preserve them from change, sometimes because of the fear that texts and mate-rial components may lose their efficacy once innovated. In the end, manuscripts may also ‘perform an embodiment’ of the holy figures described in their texts and images: the books act as material instantiations of saints, for instance, and \n",

Apart from the often spectacular ways in which manuscripts can have pro-found effects on audiences, many of which are defining experiences, there is a striking commonality in the various cases found in this final section: manu-scripts can become performers themselves when actors consciously establish a relation between manuscripts and performances. Sometimes, this is only appar-ent indirectly through various clues in the manuscripts, while in other cases it is more obvious, for instance when the object of the performance is the production of a manuscript or its use in healing and protective rituals. There are even situa-tions where this performativity of manuscripts is so deeply embedded in a cul-tural setting that practical and speculative bodies of knowledge and beliefs are developed in order to account for it and ensure a socially beneficial and con-trolled exercise of this power. Laura Fernández Fernández analyses a corpus of scientific manuscripts commissioned by the Castilian king, Alfonso X, nicknamed ‘the Wise’ (1221–1284), which were produced in his royal scriptorium. For the king, this under-taking – commissioning manuscripts reflecting different forms of the arts and multifaceted domains of knowledge – was an essential part of his cultural pro-ject and his political ideals. These manuscripts were primarily diplomatic and political tools designed to induce specific effects in his contemporaries and less a way of fostering the arts and sciences, however. Whatever their purpose was, they shaped the king’s persona in historiography. Antonella Brita’s article is concerned with a large body of hagiographic manuscripts produced in Ethiopia from the fourteenth century onwards. The textual and codicological features of these multiple-texts manuscripts evolved over the course of time, which helps in understanding profound evolutions in the religious life of the communities where these manuscripts were produced, used and circulated. In particular, this shows how local saints were increasingly incorporated into the devotional practices of the country, which had previously only related to foreign saints. The inclusion of texts on local saints in the manu-scripts legitimised them as holy figures worthy of worship, reciprocally trans-forming even the materiality of the manuscripts. Thus, the manuscripts per-formed veneration practices and contributed to shaping the local religious identity. The author also analyses how some of the holiness virtues of saints are partly present in (the texts and images of) a manuscript and can be transmitted to the participant in devotional and healing rituals. By reading words from a manuscript out loud, for instance, the officiant’s breath is embedded with spe-\n",

In her paper, Heidi Buck-Albulet considers a situation where the production of a manuscript is one of the central elements of a performance, namely collec-tive poetry-writing in Japan. The tradition of producing renga manuscripts col-lectively began there several centuries ago and has been kept up to this day. Like Antonella Brita, Heidi Buck-Albulet was able to rely on her own direct ob-servation of such performances. Comparing the manuscripts produced in differ-ent contemporary contexts to those from the pre-modern period, she studies the mutual relations between the manuscripts, the poems they contain and the collective procedures followed to produce the poem and manuscript. Finally, relying on an analysis of the terminology employed by the participants to de-scribe these performances, she demonstrates that they possess elaborate knowledge of the relationship between the manuscripts and their performance, which is then compared to our own analytical categories as historians.  In her survey of Latin liturgical manuscripts, Laura Albiero analyses their relationship to performance in three different respects, which broadly corre-spond to the three parts of this book. Echoing the articles by Heidi Buck-Albulet and Antonella Brita in some ways, albeit in a very different setting, she points out how the making of liturgical manuscripts can be understood as a perfor-mance in itself. Given the religious and ritual nature of the performances with which these manuscripts are connected, the author highlights the foundational role of manuscript production and use within religious institutions, thus demonstrating that the cultural and social performativity of the manuscripts investigated goes beyond the actual ritual in which they are direct performers.  The religious and political performativity of manuscripts as described by his-torical actors themselves is the underlying thread in Felix Heinzer’s contribution. The author makes use of the actor-network theory developed by Bruno Latour and others in presenting three case studies from the context of Western Latin Christian tradition. He highlights the agency of manuscripts in a network including human partners and analyses how books acted and were used as material representatives of the divinity and authority of saintly and historical figures. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------Abstract: The article deals with the status and use of prompt books in the West-ern literary theatre of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It focuses on the German-language tradition and the materials of the Hamburg-based collec-tion Theater-Bibliothek. Prompt books at that time contained the literary basis of a theatrical performance, which, however, had to be constantly adapted to the actual conditions of the theatre. Whenever a prompt book was used, it was revised accordingly, so that each of these written artefacts also displays its own material performance. The article presents the manuscript practices employed in this process and the theatrical contexts in which these written artefacts were used. This is then further illustrated by the example of two prompt books from the nineteenth century. \n",
      "level4\t --------1 Introduction \n",
      "level9\t ------------------The double meaning of the phrase ‘performing (with) manuscripts’ quite accu-rately refers to an influential constellation in the history of western European theatre. In its various centres in early modern Europe, the dramatic text was increasingly considered as the centre of a theatrical performance. The action on stage was based on a text that, at some point, had been written down by hand, and then practised by the actors. They performed ‘with’ a manuscript in that, historically, most European theatre cultures had a prompter, i.e. someone who fed the actors their lines should they become stuck. Traditionally, the prompter was close to the stage but hidden with the manuscript in hand (or a print edition that had been updated manually). In this sense, the manuscript was materially present during the performance; prompters ‘performed with manuscripts’ in order to support the manuscript-based performance on stage. The second meaning, ‘performing manuscripts’, refers to the material dy-namics characteristic of these written artefacts. When in use, they were revised whenever the production was changed, i.e. lines were added or cut, information on the scenery was altered, etc. In becoming a living document of a specific performance history, each of these written artefacts also put a material perfor-\n",

Until recently, scholars of literature, theatre and both had dedicated little attention to the written artefacts in question, i.e. to the material intersection of literary foundation and theatrical processes. Histori-cally, this intersection was the prompt book. It contained a master copy of the dramatic text that, when put to use, was adapted, and updated according to the various requirements of the respective theatre production. Several hands might have been involved in this, turning each book into a unique multi-layered writ-ten artefact that interconnects the multiple agents and technologies, making theatre an overall set of cultural practices. In this sense, it is the manuscript that starts to perform. This paper will focus on these specific artefacts in which both meanings co-incide on a material level: prompt books were the manuscripts (or sometimes hybrid written artefacts) on which a theatrical performance relied. As a func-tional element of the respective processes, they were, in their material dynam-ics, performative themselves. A first step introduces the contexts in which prompt books were used, and the ways in which this use took place, especially on a material level; and, at the same time, it will outline our methodological approach. A second step will then present a case study. The paper concentrates on the German theatre tradition, taking the Hamburg-based collection Theater-Bibliothek (‘Theatre Library’) with its mid-eighteenth- to mid-nineteenth-century materials as its distinct point of reference. It is a particularly rich collection that bears witness to the vibrant activities in one of Germany’s theatre centres of the time. The Theater-Bibliothek includes around 3,050 spoken theatre books for 2,100 plays that were produced under various directors at the theatre at Ham-burg Gänsemarkt from around 1765 to 1850. Most of these artefacts are bound paper manuscripts with a cardboard cover in various sizes. About five hundred are printed books, which were revised by hand when put to use.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------In the course of the eighteenth century, the beginning of a far-reaching trans-formation of theatre took place in the German-speaking areas. Initially influ-enced by the French theatre tradition of the seventeenth century, intellectuals devised an understanding of theatre that was meant to elevate its social reputa-tion and change its aesthetic practices. In this context, a literary text was posit-ed as the central element of a performance. Text-based performances were to replace the improvisations by actors and actresses that had been dominant until then. These improvisations would combine rather loosely connected scenes, focus on physical action and respond immediately to the mood of the audience. Instead, what happened on stage was then stipulated quite meticulously. Char-acters, conflicts and storylines had been written down beforehand in a text that was then supposed to be staged as a dramatic score.\n",

Thus, the new theatre practices generated their very own manuscript practices. For a given theatre production the prompt book was this dramatic score: a master copy that did not only contain the full text but also the modifications and amendments that occurred during its integration into the theatrical pro-cesses. In other words, these written artefacts merge a production’s literary point of reference with the concrete requirements regarding its staging.\n",

Using a slightly different conceptual framing, they study prompt books and related written artefacts in their historical contexts from the Middle Ages to contemporary theatre. \n",

At some point, during a crucial scene in the fourth act, the second scribe took over. The scene consists of a dialogue between the character Rolla and the high priest who, at this point, reveals himself to be his father. The first scribe refers to this high priest as ‘D. Ob.pr.’, an abbreviation for ‘Der Oberpriester’ (‘The High Priest’). Yet, there is also a high priestess in the play, and the scribe who took over during the scene apparently confused the two. He took up the abbreviation as ‘Die Ob.P.’ indicating with the definite article that he is referring to the fe-male character. Obviously, he had not paid too much attention to the content he was copying as the character is explicitly addressed as an old man in the scene (Fig. 1).  \n",

      "level9\t ------------------The mistake was never corrected; it did not affect one of the main functions of the book: being the prompter’s tool to feed lines to the actors and actresses showing up on stage. In the Hamburg collection, these lines, i.e. everything the characters say, are written down in German cursive (Kurrentschrift) whereas all other parts of the text, such as stage directions, dramatis personae or the details of the act, scene and plot are written in black letter (Fraktur) or in traditional book hands (bastarda). Nevertheless, a great variety of visual organisation can be observed even within the books of a single theatre company. The content is written on folded paper quires in whatever kind of commonplace paper and commonplace ink seemed to have been readily at hand. In some cases, different paper types were used for the same prompt book. The quires were then bound together be-tween a simple cardboard cover. Size and colour may vary from prompt book to prompt book. All in all, the materials used are generally rather inexpensive as prompt books were mere objects of utility in their theatre contexts and not of a particular value as artefacts, but the purpose they had to fulfil was a complex one. The prompters themselves, whose tasks historically went beyond feeding the actors and actresses their lines, were the main users. In Hamburg, for exam-ple, the prompter took care of the theatre company’s library, i.e. he kept the manuscripts in good order as well as the casting record, the wardrobe record, a prop book and a stage set book that would contain the respective information for the repertoire.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------7\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Generally, his area of responsibilities included anything that had to do with the written artefacts put to use in, or needed for, a production: props in writing, such as letters, were created by him. The prompter also super-vised the scribes excerpting the single parts of a play for the performers, who would only receive copies of their own lines (or he would write these parts him-self). His responsibility for the prompt books did not only encompass their crea-tion, but also their very use in a given production. Of course, if required, a prompter had to prompt: the right lines with the right timing. He sometimes had to give signs for sound effects or changes of the lighting and the stage design during a performance. And he had to keep the content of the respective book up to date. Because once a prompt book was put to use, and for that duration, it was constantly modified according to the various pragmatic, technical and aesthetic requirements of a production: when a play was too long, its plot was too complicated, its content too drastic, or when there simply were not enough \n",

All these aspects of using a prompt book corresponded with material operations. The functional integration of a dramatic text into theatrical process-es took place through various manuscript practices in the respective book. This transformed the basis for the theatrical performance, i.e. for practices such as rehearsing and staging a play, into a performative written artefact as these ephemeral practices and processes manifested themselves in, and interacted, with the prompt book in a material fashion whenever it was updated. For the actual prompting during a performance the prompter obviously had to be able to orient himself in his prompt book. The initial visual organisation that differentiated via distinct fonts between the character’s lines and other textual elements was already of help as it intuitively indicated which part of the content potentially needed to be prompted. In addition to the different fonts, the information concerning the speaking person, the setting of the scene and the occurring actions was sometimes under-lined once or twice in the same or a different colour. All these distinctions gave the prompt book’s content a clear arrangement from the outset. Yet, in order to further accentuate the different levels of the dramatic text, and therefore facili-tate the use of the book during a performance, textual elements such as stage directions and indications of the setting were sometimes not only underlined, but also marked with a bracket or even crossed out (as of no specific interest to the prompter). There were also cases in which the prompter did not only need to know what, but also when, to prompt or rather: when not to. Occasionally, one finds the word ‘pause’ written next to a certain part of the text. It is a note to the user of the book, which reminds the prompter that any silence on stage at this mo-ment is no mistake, but intended by the actor or the actress as part of his/her role. An example for such an amendment that directs the prompter’s perfor-mance during the performance of a play can be found in Theater-Bibliothek, 2029, a prompt book that contains famous Hamburg theatre director and actor Friedrich Ludwig Schröder’s adaptation of William Shakespeare’s King Lear. Schröder himself played the title-role for many years. In the scene where Lear is rejected by his two daughters Gonerill and Regan, and slowly realises their fun-damental betrayal, he utters with the most severe disappointment: ‘Ich gab Euch alles!’\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ This type of information was connected immediately to the prompter’s tasks during a performance and at the same time made it possible to repeat the per-formance in a similar fashion the night (or year) after. Such modifications also turned the text book into a technical score. Apart from using the prompt book during a performance, the prompter also had to keep this material basis of both his own performance and the theatrical performance of the play up to date. As already mentioned, a play that was sup-posed to be staged needed to be adjusted to the concrete conditions and re-quirements of the theatre – on a technical, aesthetical and normative level. Elements of the play – dialogues, scenes or characters – were changed or left out when not enough actors and actresses were available, when it generally was too long, when the plot needed to be condensed, or when they conflicted with certain expectations and standards. The respective amendments had to be un-derstood as updates in that none of them were final but always prone to new changes as circumstances may have demanded. Any modification could itself be modified again and so on. The prompt book was not deemed a container of sacrosanct content but a mere object of utility. It was not unusual that such amendments were inserted by different hands since productions would some-times remain part of the repertoire for decades. A resumption after a long hiatus might have called for potential adjustments due to changing theatrical fashions, social customs or tone. Especially when a prompt book had been in use for a longer period and/or served as the foundation for different productions, its users are certain to have varied. The most common types of amendments are deletions, additions and re-placements of content. For example, when parts of the dramatic text were no longer supposed to be performed on stage, or when entire scenes were some-times taken out of the play, the respective sections were crossed out – some-times quite orderly with straight or crossing lines, sometimes in a rather hasty and chaotic fashion. In case a deletion was accompanied by an addition, when for instance the text of a character had been revised, the newly added content was written down somewhere nearby, in-between the lines or, when there was enough space, next to it in the margin. When there was not enough free space \n",
      "level10\t --------------------|| 11 Cf. for example Theater-Bibliothek, 2029, p. 54. For some of these technical aspects, timing was very important in order to prevent that for instance a change of scenery that was supposed to happen in the back of the stage started before the action could move to the edge of the stage. \n",

These different operations were carried out to establish the latest version of the foundation of a given performance on a material level. However, the materi-al scope of a modification did not necessarily correspond to its importance on a content level. Sometimes this relation could be quite disproportional. When, for example, the above-mentioned theatre director Schröder tried to prevent his 1776 adaptation of Shakespeare’s Othello from failing, he turned the tragic into a happy ending – an ending in which the raging and jealousy-driven Othello does not stab his innocent wife Desdemona. As the respective stage direction was no longer valid in the revised version of the play, it was simply crossed out.

Con-stant updates could then develop the potential to impede both purposes. At some point there is simply no more free space left on a folium or a page.

Otherwise, one will neither understand which operations formed the basis for the different layers of writing to emerge and how they interacted, nor which intra- and extra-theatrical requirements and demands motivated the respective revisions, nor that these revisions had the character of updates that were never final, but only valid until revoked. Only such an interdisciplinary perspective makes it possible to connect written arte-fact and cultural context; for example, to realise that the mentioned deletion of Othello’s murder was caused by negative audience reactions caused, in turn, by a transgression of both aesthetic and social norms in the play. Or that the revi-sion of the technical annotations at the beginning of King Lear’s third act had to do with subsequently shifting this beginning to the next scene, probably in order to facilitate a change of scenery during the performance.\n",

Vice versa, there are alterations in Theater-Bibliothek, 1988b that did not occur in Theater-Bibliothek, 1988a. Therefore, it can be assumed that both books were not always put to use simultaneously so that there were periods when only one of them was in use. Furthermore, it ap-pears that Theater-Bibliothek, 1988a served as a book also operated and updat-ed by a prompter, at least for some time. A piece of information that is essential for understanding the material per-formance of both artefacts can be found right on the title page of Theater-Bibliothek, 1988a.

In this part, Sal-adin defends Nathan against the Templar’s accusation of actually believing his own religion to be superior. At least, this is what he does before the revision and what, according to the logic of the character, he should still be doing afterwards. However, it remains somewhat unclear whether the praise at the end of the en-riched version really comes from him and, due to the excessive material perfor-mance, it is questionable which version of the text was ultimately valid. The red pencil is the first instrument in this multi-layered sequence of amend-ments and this pencil already establishes three different versions of the dialogue. At first, it only takes out the Templar’s reply and the beginning of Saladin’s subse-quent reply so that the connection still works.

A second modification by the red pencil puts these words in the Templar’s mouth before a third modification shifts it back to Saladin, cancelling the Tem-plar’s reply. This is also the version the grey pencil establishes at some point. The black ink is now somewhere in between. With the respective section framed in black ink, the weg (‘leave out’) and the cancellation of the latest red-pencil modifi-cation, indicated by the bleibt (‘remains’), the second red-pencil version seems to be confirmed: the Templar praises Nathan. Yet, the slightly bent vertical line on the right side seems to include the Templar’s respective reply and therefore seems to coincide with the third red-pencil version. If one interprets this vertical line to be a bit shorter and coextensive with the frame, then the praise of Nathan connects to the Templar’s underlined reply. The other way around, it would be connected to Saladin’s prior response. The latter is likely to be the case. It would simply make no sense at this point if the Templar praised Nathan for not succumbing to self-righteous religious delusion, when that is precisely what he has just accused him of. The multiple layers of revisions and the back and forth of cancellations, and their subsequent, cancellations create material ambiguity where there is great clarity at the content level. Even though such complex cases might not be solved completely, it be-comes obvious that the multiple layers in a prompt book are interconnected. They do not only modify the initial content but also respond to each other, fur-ther modifying prior modifications.

It looks like any other deletion in this prompt book or in others, but the underlying motivation differs: these lines have not been cancelled to shorten the scene. It is more likely that they were cancelled because they por-trayed a negative image of the Church. The Patriarch says, ‘Denn ist / Nicht alles, was man Kindern tut, Gewalt? – / Zu sagen: – ausgenommen, was die Kirch’ / An Kindern tut’ (‘Is not everything one does to children some form of violence?

In several similar cases in Theater-Bibliothek, 1988a, mainly deletions are used to significantly reduce the negative light in which a fanatic form of the Christian religion is depicted in the play. In contrast to modifications regarding the scenery or the duration of a play, it is fair to assume that these modifications were not motivated by theatrical requirements; nor were they motivated by aesthetic norms such as the altera-tion of particularly violent actions or an indecent language. They occurred in order to avoid a conflict with a powerful institution that had traditionally held a remarkably bad opinion on the performing arts.\n",

The two Nathan der Weise prompt books are typical examples for the use of such written artefacts. As part of their integration into theatre processes, they are revised and updated according to both intra- and extra-theatrical require-ments and demands. The concrete operations that correspond to these influ-ences turn each prompt book itself into a performative written artefact that is operated by a prompter when the play is being performed. The respective writ-ten artefact displays a material performance that is individual in each prompt book. This material performance has to be the focus of interdisciplinary analysis that is necessary to better comprehend this type of written artefact: not only does it interconnect the respective operations, the deletions, additions, re-placements and their dynamics, but also the written artefacts and their artistic and cultural contexts. \n",

The Assyrian sources inform us mainly about performances in observation, interpretation and ritual practice.

      "level9\t ------------------The richest evidence of performative aspects of Mesopotamian astral science is contained in the letters and reports which the practitioners of celestial divina-tion, i.e. ‘astronomers’,\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------8\n",

      "level10\t -------------------- \n",
      "level9\t ------------------It is important to note that the Akkadian verb ‘to watch’ (naṣāru) covers both visual perception and protection, as Simo Parpola has described:\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------12\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ \n",
      "level10\t --------------------A plain rendering is incapable of expressing the full meaning of the phrase (‘watch of the king’), which involved watching, guarding and protecting the king […]. This the court scholars did by watching for and interpreting signs that the gods sent and advising the king how these signs should be reacted to; by guarding the king’s behaviour in cultic and other areas to prevent him from becoming cultically impure or from performing some task on an inauspicious day; by protecting the king from portended evil and divine wrath through apotropaic rituals […]; [and] by restoring the harmony between the king and the gods through ritual purification ceremonies. \n",
      "level9\t ------------------‘Carrying out the watch of the king’ was therefore an inherently performative practice.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ It was performed in teams of collaborating scholars headed by a chief scholar with access to the king.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------14\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Four kinds of performances alluded to in the letters and reports are briefly addressed for the present purpose. First, the ob-servations themselves. They were often performed by single scholars, presuma-bly at home, but some reports mention joint observations, as in the following report by chief scholar Issar-šumu-ēreš:\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------15\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ \n",
      "level10\t --------------------[As to] what the king, my lord wrote to me: ‘The clouds were dense, how did you observe that the gods [moon and sun] saw each other [in opposition]?’ They dispersed before day-break; when he [the moon god Sin] whom the king, my lord, knows, revealed himself, we saw where Sin was standing. It amounts to an actual observation. Now, does not the king, my lord, [indeed] hear that they saw each other on the 14th? \n",
      "level9\t ------------------Issar-šumu-ēreš is replying to a letter in which the king questioned the reliabil-ity of an observation. He affirms its validity, stressing that he was not the only witness. Joint observations are also mentioned in a report by a scholar called Balasî,\n",

      "level10\t -------------------- | Mathieu Ossendrijver \n",
      "level9\t ------------------As in legal practice, reports based on testimony by multiple witnesses were more authoritative than reports by a single witness. Moreover, each scholar could scrutinise the performance of the other, and disagreements could be re-solved in situ. Uncovering the meaning of the signs was primarily a text-based operation which required profound knowledge of divinatory literature, in particular com-pendia of omens, i.e. collections of statements of the kind ‘if P, then Q’. In their reports, the scholars usually quote a selection of omens from these compendia, rather than describing the phenomena in their own words. This reflects the authority of the omen compendia, which had the status of divinely revealed knowledge. The astronomers were called ‘scribes of Enūma Anu Enlil’, after the main compendium of celestial omens entitled Enūma Anu Enlil (‘When Anu and Enlil’). It comprised about seventy tablets arranged in more or less coherent groups dedicated to lunar, solar, meteorological, planetary and stellar phenom-ena.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------18\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ After the omens that were considered relevant for interpreting an ob-served phenomenon were identified, they were compared and evaluated, which could require the use of commentaries and consultations with colleagues. It was also common practice to seek confirmation or annulment of the celestial signs through extispicy (divination by inspecting the entrails of sacrificed animals). In this case, the extispicy specialist (barû) addressed a prayer to the sun god and divine judge Šamaš, asking him to write down a verdict in a sheep’s body. The signs on the sheep’s liver were then interpreted and their predictions com-pared with those inferred from the celestial signs.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------19\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ It was not always sufficient to pass on the information to the king in written form. A third type of performance was a consultation in which scholars at the court reported their interpretations to the king and advised him about possible action to take. Sometimes the king had to be convinced with the help of authorita-tive texts, as mentioned in the following report by chief scholar Issar-šumu-ēreš:\n",

Also, let them give us the Akkadian writing board of the king; the ‘Three Stars Each’ should be drawn on it.

      "level9\t ------------------Some consultations took place in a sacred enclosure by the river called a qersu, as mentioned in the following report:\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------21\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ \n",
      "level10\t --------------------[To the king, my lord, your servant Nabû-aḫḫē-ēriba. Good health to the k]ing, my lord! May [Nabû] and Marduk bless the king, my lord! Concerning the report on the eclipse of [the moon god] Sin about which the king, my lord, wrote to me – they used to receive and introduce all the reports of the scribes of Enūma Anu Enlil into the presence of the father of the king, my lord. Afterwards, a man whom the father of the king, my lord, knew used to read them to the king in a qersu on the river bank. Nowadays it should be done as it suits the king, my lord. \n",
      "level9\t ------------------This underscores the ritual nature of the consultation and the divine origin of the message that was conveyed to the king. Finally, there are ritual and other performances aimed at counteracting un-favourable predictions or protecting the king. Since the astronomers were also competent in various ritual disciplines,\n",

The astronomers who wrote these texts were called ‘scribes of Enūma Anu Enlil’ as in earlier times. No private cor-respondence of the Babylonian astronomers comparable to the letters and re-ports from Niniveh is available, but some information about their institutional, professional and private lives can be gleaned from colophons and from admin-istrative documents from temple archives. They were employed as priests at the Esagila and received a fixed income for their astronomical services (see below). They belonged to a small cluster of scholarly families in which the priestly and scholarly professions were passed on from father to son. Having received a scribal, priestly and scholarly education and being employed at Babylon’s main temple, they were also competent in ritual and cultic affairs. The authors of the diaries and related texts were steeped in a cultic tradition with strict and elabo-rate rules regarding what counts as appropriate and correct performance. More-over, they carried out their astronomical activities in a setting where all kinds of ritual performances were enacted on a daily basis, probably with their own involvement. It seems plausible that this affected their performance of astro-nomical observations.  \n",

As Fig. 1 shows, they are products of a cycle of operations involving both observation and prediction. What kind of performances are attested or implied in the different stages of the production cycle? We may start with short-term reports, which were the source for the dia-ries. Compared to half-yearly diaries, relatively few have survived because they were discarded once their content had been processed. In his pioneering study, Yasuyuki Mitsuma distinguishes two types of short-term reports.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------27\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ ‘Preliminary diaries’ report astronomical and weather data, sometimes also the river level, for typically a few days. ‘Short diaries’ usually contain all categories of data known from the half-yearly diaries, including the market rates of agricultural commodities, and historical and local events, for intervals of at most c. two months. Both ‘preliminary diaries’ and ‘short diaries’ covering up to a few days are often written with progressively shallower signs since the tablet became more difficult to inscribe as the clay dried up from day to day. It follows that they were written as the data was collected.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------28\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Since the observations were made at the beginning and end of the night, the scholars must have used an artificial source of light and a water clock to measure time intervals and an instrument – perhaps one similar to a medieval Jacob’s staff – to measure the distance from the Moon or the planets to nearby fixed stars. The astronomical watch was a thoroughly prepared and controlled proce-dure. Most phenomena that were reported were selected for observation and pre-dicted in advance. Only a few unexpected or unpredictable phenomena were reported.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------On day 13, near full moon, the time from moonrise to sunset is reported as 10;30 UŠ (= 42 minutes), but is marked as ‘not observed’ (literally, ‘I did not watch’). It follows that the reported number was computed. Mercury’s first appearance in the evening is reported on that same day, along with the theoretical date of the phenomenon, day 11. It follows that predictive texts were consulted before and perhaps during the observation so that the astronomer knew which phenomena to observe, where to look and what to report if the expected phenomena could not be observed. Texts known as ‘almanacs’ and ‘Normal Star almanacs’ were almost certainly the source of these predictions (see below). It follows that in addition to a water clock, a measuring stick, a source of light and a clay tablet or wooden board inlaid with wax, the astronomers may also have carried along a predictive almanac and/or Normal Star almanac. This would, in turn, suggest that the astronomers had assistants with them or observed the stars in pairs, but there is no actual evidence to support this. Half-yearly diaries, which are the most widely preserved subgenre, usually contain a highly stable selection of astronomical, meteorological, economic and historical data spanning around half a calendar year, i.e. six or seven months.\n",

This must have been done in a location where the short dia-ries were collected, presumably in the temple compound. The half-yearly diaries were produced for long-term storage in a reference library. The range of months in the diary was written on the upper edge of the tablet using the phrase ‘Regular watch from month M to month N of year Y of (King) NN’. This allowed the scholars to retrieve a diary easily if the tablets were placed vertically on shelves or in brick niches, as is attested for some Babylonian libraries. As mentioned above, most of the reported astronomical phenomena were also predicted. The diaries were indirectly the source of these predictions. The underlying method, known as the Goal-Year method in modern scholarship, is based on the principle that lunar and planetary phenomena return to nearly the \n",

      "level9\t ------------------Abstract: In the following contribution the author analyses a particular example of a type of liturgical book known as ‘breviary’. First, the forms of Divine Office during the Middle Ages are briefly presented. Secondly, the author reflects on the nature and use of a portable breviary, using the late-fifteenth-century man-uscript from the abbey of San Zeno Maggiore in Verona, Kremsmünster, Stifts-bibliothek, CC60. The particular nature and form in which this breviary is used is analysed by comparing its format, layout, and contents to other types of litur-gical books. The author then concludes by underlining how portable breviaries, like the one presented here, could be considered liturgical as well as devotional: they were used privately, but also reflected the liturgical forms and contents of the community in which they were embedded. \n",

However, in this paper I would like to start at an end: I will begin at the end of the process leading to the unification of many liturgical books in the Middle Ages that had previously been used by different ritual actors into one single book manufactured for a single person to use. I would like to talk about the so-called ‘breviary’, a type of liturgical manuscript used by Christian clerics and monks to perform the Divine Office.

Firstly, using this breviary and, in particular, its transmission of the office for Saint Zeno, I will initially trace back some of the liturgical book types that preceded the breviary genealogically, and compare them to the breviary. The comparison will focus on codicology and the treatment of the liturgical texts.

      "level9\t ------------------ Such forms and structure of the Christian Divine Office shall be briefly summarized here, so that some of the concepts used in the course of this article may become clear from the start. The Divine Office is the second essential area of liturgical activity next to Mass, in which Jesus’s death on the cross is re-enacted through the celebration of the Eucharist. The celebration of the Eucharist, during which another series of liturgical actions is performed, is not a part of Divine Office. The term ‘divine office’ is the translation of the Latin divinum officium, which means divine duty or service. It designates the cycle of prayers, chants and lessons that are to be performed as a service to God by monks and the clergy every day, both at day and at night. A reference to this duty can be found in the Bible in Luke 18:1: ‘oportet semper orare et non deficere’ (‘It is one’s duty always to pray and never \n",

This perennial praise is maintained symbolically in the practice of Divine Office, during which prayer takes place at each hour of day-time and night-time. The office of important feast days began on the previous day before sunset, at the so-called vesper, which is a practice still upheld nowadays at Christmas. On most days, however, the office begins at matins, which take place during the night. During matins the office is sung three times, each one of them called a nocturne. The matins are followed by lauds, which are sung at day-break. During the day, office is sung four times, at the so-called canonical hours. It is time to sing vesper again before dark, and compline also takes place before going to bed.\n",

The psalms were accompanied by antiphons, namely short texts, in prose or in verse, drawn from the psaltery itself or from the Bible. They could also be non-biblical new compositions, mostly connected with the saint’s bio-graphical texts, called vita. Antiphons are only sung in connection with a psalm or a new-testamentary canticle (like the Magnificat during vesper or the Bene-dictus during lauds). Lessons also constituted one of the most important parts of the matins, and could also be taken from the Bible or from the saint’s biograph-ical text. A responsory, namely a chant with a text taken from the Bible or drawn from the saint’s vita, was sung after a lesson. It consisted of two parts sung by different groups, namely the choir and the soloist. \n",

Some of these book types will be discussed in the course of this paper starting from the example of the manuscript Krems-münster, Stiftsbibliothek, CC60. As a breviary, this manuscript contains all items that were needed for the celebration of the office, which were at this point no longer scattered in different books but collected in one single volume. The advantage of such a liturgical book is evident: all material needed for the ritual performance is summarized in a single manuscript and is often organized fol-lowing the yearly liturgical cycle of the feasts. While the breviary is much handier for its medieval user, it is also less easily studied by the modern researcher. The form and content of a liturgical Rollen-buch clearly reveal for which group of ritual actors it was intended to be used, but for whose use was a breviary intended? And how? The answers to these questions lie in the manuscripts themselves. To answer them by way of example the mentioned breviary Kremsmünster, Stiftsbibliothek, CC60 shall now be studied in more detail.

The manuscript can be dated precisely thanks to some computistical texts that it contains. With these texts, the owner was able to calculate, among other things, the dates of the year’s Sundays. The Sunday, or dies dominica (‘day of the Lord’) was of particular liturgical importance, and the liturgical service on this day was more elaborate than the one on a ferial day. Since these tables enable us to calculate the dates of the Sundays for the years 1467–1494, the codex must have been produced in 1467. The manuscript can also be localized thanks to its calendar, which was written by the main hand of the codex. The feasts listed here are typical for a Benedictine house (for instance the feast of Saint Benedict), and there are also some regional and local peculiarities that allow to determine precisely where it had been produced and used: namely in Verona, and, specifically, in the Benedictine abbey of San Zeno Maggiore. \n",

Zeno was the protector of the monastery, which literally belonged, with all its monks and its goods, to the saint himself. It was extremely important for the cloister that Zeno was bur-ied here because it made the monastery the institution that could uniquely claim to possess the saint’s earthly remains.

      "level9\t ------------------ includes the rubric ‘In natale sancti Zenonis ad vesperum antipho-na’ (‘The antiphon for vespers of the feast of Saint Zeno’) and some lines later ‘Alia antiphona’ (‘Another antiphon’). More antiphons, responsories and the incipits of psalms follow. It becomes clear that the antiphonary only transmits the chants and records their melodies, thus fixating the musical notation. The fact that only this particular content is transmitted in such a manuscript has a direct consequence on its layout, making it very different from the layout of our breviary. In the antiphonary one finds the script in a single column that extends over the whole page, not in two columns. Also, the interlinear spaces in the antiphonary are more abundant, and even the text that accompanies the melo-dy must adapt its form to the musical notation: the single word is divided into syllables, and their position follows the distribution of the notes, or the groups of notes (melismas). Hence, the first important differences between a portable breviary and the liturgical manuscripts preceding its invention are that (1) the breviary transmits all material needed for the celebration of the office without distinguishing between different musical and textual genres, (2) it does not register the musical notation of the chanted elements and (3) its mise-en-page reflects the effort of transmitting as much text as possible in the smallest possi-ble space. In addition to these aspects, the treatment of the transmitted textual mate-rial also distinguishes a breviary from its ancestor book types, which is also evident in the breviary from San Zeno Maggiore.

As in the case of Saint Zeno for the Veronese abbey, the textual material for such readings was often provided by the biography of the saint. During the liturgy on his or her feast day, and especially during the night office (matins), a long portion taken from the text of the saint’s life, or vita, was read aloud to the members of the cloister that were gathered in the choir of the church to perform the office. In this way the life and deeds of an exemplary individual, who in this case was also patron of the cloister, were meditated upon by the group. Furthermore, the significance and ‘formative force’\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ Another earlier manuscript from the abbey of San Zeno Maggiore transmits the same vita of Saint Zeno, Verona, Biblioteca Capitolare, XCVI(90*). The man-uscript can be dated to the late twelfth century and contains a collection of vitae of saints venerated in Verona at this time. But the manuscript did not only col-lect these texts, it was also used in liturgy, and can thus be categorized as a hagiographical lectionary for the office. This is indicated by a series of margina-lia inscribed in the manuscript. Firstly, at least two series of roman numerals in brown and red ink can be traced in the lectionary’s margins (Fig. 4).\n",

The vita of Zeno and other hagio-graphical texts transmitted in the codex are divided into eight or twelve lessons, which correspond to the number of readings required by the structure of the mo-nastic night office. Hence, the codex was used by a monastic community, the abbey of San Zeno Maggiore, as a second set of marginalia indicates, and not by an episcopal church, like the cathedral of Verona, despite the fact that the manu-script ended up in the library of the episcopal chapter. As to the second set of marginalia, these comprise short rubrics written by a hand contemporary to the main text that indicate on which occasion the biography of Saint Zeno was to be read aloud. In the left margin of p. 282, for instance, the rubric reads ‘In transla-tione sancti Zenonis’, thus prescribing that this portion of the text was to be read during the feast of the so-called translatio, on the day (namely the 21 May) that the \n",

This difference becomes evident not only with regard to the struc-ture and layout, but also with regard to the fact that the treatment of the trans-mitted textual material differs greatly in the different types of liturgical manu-script. This especially concerns the material for the readings. While the lessons from the hagiographical lectionary Verona, Biblioteca Capitolare, XCVI(90*) contain an average of c. seventy words, the lessons in the breviary are much shorter and contain an average of only thirty words, less than half.

      "level9\t ------------------All the information gained through an analysis of the format, layout and con-tent of the breviary as well as its comparison with other liturgical codices is fundamental to reach a deeper understanding of this particular type of liturgical book. In the case of the late medieval breviary from the abbey of San Zeno Mag-giore, the analysis revealed that the manuscript can be categorized as a portable breviary and it contains all liturgical material for the celebration of the Divine Office. Additionally, it is evident that this material had not only been fitted into the smallest space possible, but was also transmitted without musical notation, and its contents had been, in some cases, heavily abbreviated. Still, the two following important questions remain unanswered: ‘Who used this artefact?’ and: ‘How did he or she use it?’ Luckily, a number of liturgical materials recorded in the book can deliver an answer to at least the first of these questions. Firstly, on fols 14–19, a series of so-called ordines can be found. An ordo describes and regulates how special rituals should be performed. The breviary from San Zeno Maggiore contains ordines for monastic rites usually performed by the abbot, for instance one for the ordaining of a monk (‘ordo ad faciendum monachum’) and one describing how to welcome guests or pilgrims (‘ordo ad suscipiendum hospites seu pere-grinos in porta monasterii’). Also, an ordo containing instructions on how to bless the monks’ refectory is transmitted in the codex and corresponds with a text used particularly in the southern German abbey of Tegernsee in Bavaria. It will be necessary to come back to this point further on in the article. Secondly, on fol. 90\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------r\n",
      "level9\t ------------------, the manuscript records a series of so-called absolutions, blessings. The abbot pronounced a blessing at the end of every hour during his office.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------20\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ In this manuscript, the blessings are ordered following the hour of prayer during which they were delivered. Thus, they are introduced by rubrics like: ‘In primo nocturno absolutio’, ‘In secundo nocturno absolutio’, etc. The fact that the brev-iary transmits texts decidedly pertinent to the abbot reveals quite clearly that the book was intended for no less than the abbot of San Zeno Maggiore. The small codex supplied him with everything he needed to perform not only the daily office (e.g. the blessings for all hours of prayer), but also for a series of special rituals that were not performed daily (e.g. ordaining a brother-monk or the blessing of the monastery’s living spaces). \n",

      "level9\t ------------------ The new abbot, who was nom-inated around 1465–1467, and therefore precisely at the time when CC60 was produced, may have needed a new personal breviary to become familiar with the liturgy of the abbey. Our breviary could not only give him an overview of the liturgical customs of the monastery he was to lead, but also, due to its small size, enable him to celebrate the Divine Office anywhere he wanted. To fulfil his administrative duties, the abbot was often unable to celebrate with his brothers in the choir. Not only did he often have to travel, he also even lived separated from the brothers in his private habitation when he was in the abbey. With this portable breviary, he could celebrate the office privately and also when travel-ling. Thus, this breviary was with regards to its format, layout, contents and function both a liturgical and a devotional book: it was, for its owner and carri-er, a private book that contained the rituals that only he, the abbot, would need. But since it reflected the liturgical customs of the monastic community that the abbot directed, it also was a liturgical book. Thus, this breviary is a devotional book in the sense that it could be used for the private recitation of the office.

      "level9\t ------------------To conclude, in this article I illustrated the process in which the liturgy of the hours went from being codified in multiple liturgical books for multiple users to being condensed in one book used by a single, yet prominent, liturgical actor. I focused on the example on the late medieval manuscript Kremsmünster, Stifts-bibliothek, CC60, a portable breviary from the north Italian abbey San Zeno Maggiore. Furthermore, thanks to the indications of this manuscript, it was possible to reconstruct the particular historical scenario in which such a book was needed and to reflect on its possible uses and actual performance. This leads to the conclusion that due to its contents and use, this portable breviary, like many others of its genre, can be characterized both as a liturgical and as a devotional book. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------Abstract: Sanskrit mathematical commentaries contain many different kinds of performance, some of which are embedded in the lists of the solved examples they almost always contain. The resolutions of problems contained in these lists of solved examples include representations of a working surface on which computa-tions would have been carried out or diagrams drawn. This chapter discusses how the execution of multiplications can be reconstructed with the help of these repre-sentations. I examine how these representations appear in manuscripts and edi-tions of these texts. I also reflect on the material objects on which and with which these multiplications may have been performed. The discussion is based on Pṛthūdaka’s (fl. 850) commentary on the Theoretical Treatise of the Corrected Brāhma School (Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta 628), the anonymous undated commen-tary on Śrīdhara’s (c. 800) Board Mathematics (Pāṭīgaṇita)\n",

To do so requires reflection on what the aims of Sanskrit mathematical texts were, with regard to the execution of algorithms. Was their purpose to teach how to carry out an execution and, if so, how did texts go about doing so? Furthermore, what do we know of the tools used to execute an arithmetical algorithm? Answering these questions directly may not be possible. We can however start by noting that Sanskrit mathematical treatises and commentaries did in-deed stage performances, some of which related to the execution of algorithms. \n",

Such a Sanskritist not only displays a knowledge of versification, but also demonstrates that the study of ancient South Asian texts is more than an academic discipline: it is also a live practice. The earliest medieval theoretical astronomical treatise handed down to us, the Āryabhaṭīya (499), was authored by Āryabhaṭa (b. 476), who spoke of him-self in the third person as ‘proclaiming’ (nigad-) the topics of the treatise.\n",

This notation was an extensively debated topic in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, as discussed notably in Keller 2011. 5 Most famously and consistently, Jack Goody believed in the Vedas’s pure orality, notably in Goody 2010, 166–169, a position he maintained despite much criticism, as found for instance in Falk 1990. \n",

Furthermore, the commentaries on these oral treatises are often explicitly written (likh-) texts. They too can contain quoted verses and staged dialogs. Finally, whether we are looking at South Asian language manu-scripts in general or manuscripts dealing with mathematical and astral texts in these languages, quite famously, we are overwhelmed by the sheer number of documents.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------7\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ These manuscripts are quite recent and made of fragile bark, palm leaf and paper – an abundance which suggests, in part, that transmission also involved hand copying texts. The oral performance of an astronomical or math-ematical treatise thus seems to have been a standard rhetoric for the presenta-tion of scholarly knowledge; a mise-en-scène of how ideally scholarly knowledge should be performed and transmitted without necessarily being the reality of how the text was actually passed down (in writing rather than through oral transmission?) or stored (in writing rather than in a person’s mind?).\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------8\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ This paradox of our sources and our historiographic difficulties in treating them also indicates how little we know of the contexts in which astronomical and mathematical texts in Sanskrit were composed, studied, learned, performed and copied.

Of course, we can imagine that transmission involved all these acts simul-taneously. 9 This historiography applied to the Āryabhaṭīya has been studied in Keller 2016. In Kusuba 2018, this is an underlying thread of the article, clear already from its abstract which states: ‘When students read the rules, they learned the procedure of calculation. When they read examples, they learned how to set down given numbers’. In other words, Takanori Kusuba assumes that the texts were read by students wanting to learn how to execute elementary operations. 10 For a summary of social and political issues of text, manuscript and performance in early modern India, see O’Hanlon 2013, 89–93.

      "level9\t ------------------ We might therefore wonder if these public performances can be projected back much further into the past. For most texts before the second millennium, it is however often hard to know precisely in which families, places, and institutions (temples, royal courts, village schools or city forums) the texts were composed, copied, learned, commented, and studied. More often than not, if we want to know what audi-ence the text was aimed at, and who must have performed the text, executed its algorithms and used the commentaries, we have no choice but to use the clues we get from the both texts and the manuscripts through which they have been handed down to us. We will set aside this question of context in what follows. Instead, the per-formance of an algorithm, essentially the execution of elementary operations, will be our focus here. These executions are evoked in treatises and are part of the performances staged in commentaries. \n",

They can each be treated in a separate rubric, suggesting that the resolution of a problem involves all these sub-actions, which together form one great perfor-mance: the execution of the algorithm which solves a given problem. The text of commentaries sometimes alludes to what is being done, orally, off-stage so to say, with what is placed on the working surface. Typically, in Bhāskara’s commentary on the Āryabhaṭīya, oral explanations are given on diagrams. These explanations are evoked in the texts but not explicated.\n",

An algorithm’s steps need not all be fixed precisely or in the same order, as we will see. The space in which a procedure is to be performed, and the material objects which it involves are open questions to us as historians.

      "level9\t ------------------The vocabulary associated with the execution of procedures in Sanskrit et-ymologically conveys the idea of making and of action, which is the same word (karaṇa). The same term can be used to evoke both the procedure itself and the resolution of a problem. Consequently, operations appear as the elementary building blocks from which algorithms are made. They are very literally peri-fabrications (parikarman). Other words can be used of course, some evoking methods which lead (nyāya) to a fruit/result (phala). Therefore, the execution of the algorithm and the algorithm are one and a same thing in the vocabulary. In theatre and dance, according to Sanskrit texts, if a performance is related to action (kṛ-) the performance itself has a separate name and verb (naṭ-). We do not find such distinctions in the resolution of problems or the execution of algo-rithms. However, texts that were not theatre plays but had a scholarly dimen-sion could be associated with some kind of performance, chanting intertwined with near theatrical staging, or recitation with improvisation, possibly in San-skrit and vernacular. This is notably the case of the historical law texts called ‘the ancient’ (purāṇa), which were performed by specialists, pauraṇikas.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------19\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ We can thus imagine that similarly astral texts or mathematical texts could be per-formed by the specialists of these texts.

      "level12\t ------------------------20\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ To evaluate whether they existed in the past, and in what form, we would need to document such stagings in non-mathematical and non-astral literature as well. Historians of mathematics have taken the resolution of problems as de-scribed in mathematical commentaries as a stage, set in the text, on which the resolution is performed to teach and explain how an algorithm should be exe-cuted. In other words, more often than not, historians of mathematics have approached mathematical texts as very literally describing the execution of operations and algorithms. As such then, the sūtras of mathematical treatises have appeared as faulty: aphoristic and failing to describe the intricate details necessary to reproduce an execution, while commentaries would seem to rely on much tacit knowledge. Let us first set aside, though, the idea that transmitted texts are always about enabling such performances.

Perhaps some of what is staged in the text – including the display of working surfaces – aims at inviting the reader (directly or indirectly) to try to enact a set of actions. Text by text we should try to assess which elements may invite us to think that this is the case. In all instances, choices are made in the treatises as in the commentaries on which part of the performance is shown. Each mathematical commentary has its own way of re-lating to the different performances that the resolution of a problem entails. A text can never faithfully describe and/or represent the whole set of performanc-es attached to the resolution of a problem, since these include non-discursive acts.

      "level9\t ------------------ In what follows, the intention of the texts in relation to the performance of the algorithm by a reader or hearer will not be discussed directly. However, we will have to touch on such an intention as we try to reconstruct the performance of a multiplication. We will see how discussing the performance in relation to the text helps us perceive what could have been some aspect of the author’s aim. We will consider the texts as more or less willing testimonies to how a giv-en algorithm or operation was carried out, and we will use texts as the tools we have as historians to reconstruct these executions. But we will not assume that all the texts we deal with are, as Matthieu Husson and Samuel Gessner in this volume put it, ‘toolbox’ manuscripts. This chapter tackles some of the difficult components of the reconstruction of executions, those which may specifically be concerned with performance: the material objects used, the surface on which the execution took place, and the different orders and details of those little steps in the execution of an algorithm that exhibit a know-how open to improvisation. What clues do we have about them? In what follows, this chapter looks at the dialectics of what the text states about the resolution of a problem, the representations of different stages of the working surface within the text, and how they are articulated to one another. We will do so in the case of the execution of a multiplication. It will be a way of asking on what surface, with what tools, multiplications could have been carried out. The discussion will use Pṛthūdaka’s (fl. 850) commentary (abbrev. PBSS) on the Theo-retical Treatise of the Corrected Brāhma School (Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta 628 – abbrev.

The rule then relies on two specified operands: a multiplicand (guṇya) and a multiplier (guṇakāra) which are not treated as interchangeable.

Translations of this verse can also be found in Colebrooke 1817, 319; Datta and Singh 1935, 135; and Keller and Morice-Singh 2022. 26 There is a certain amount of discussion on the reading and understanding of this name. Colebrooke 1817, 319, reads ‘cow’s string’ (go-sūtrikā) and Hayashi 2017 has recently agreed to follow him on this as this reading corresponds to what is noted in available manuscripts of the treatise and commentary. Sudhākara Dvivedin’s text, as well as Bibhutibhusan Datta and Narayan Avadesh Singh’s interpretation, suggest a different reading, go-mūtrikā. Datta and Singh 1935, 147, n. 4, evoke live oral traditions through ‘paṇḍits’, to justify their reading. The transition from the devanagarī  (ma) to  (sa) is indeed very slight and could explain the मसcorruption of the text here. The expression go-mūtrikā means lit. ‘cow’s urine’ and is a common word used to signify ‘zig-zag’. Takao Hayashi argues that there is another kind of multiplica-tion that is standardly called go-mūtrikā and which indeed corresponds to a zig-zag; while the ‘cow’s string’, which could attach several cows in a row together, may correspond better to what is described of the display. This argument however is also debatable. First, because a same name could be used to denote different multiplication executions as shown in Hayashi 2017, 58–59 and in Keller and Morice-Singh 2022. Second, although attested in dictionary entries such as the one authored by Monier Monier-Williams, the existence and use of such strings (or of such an expression) needs to be documented. Nevertheless, since the image of three cows in a diagonal row is a plausible one for this multiplication method, and since it further retains the manuscript readings, we will adopt this name for the time being. \n",

Multiplying with a multiplier subdivided into ‘portions’ (khaṇḍa) means, ac-cording to Pṛthūdaka, splitting the multiplier according to its different powers of ten. This method then depends on the fact that counting uses base ten and that multiplication is distributive over addition. Pṛthūdaka considers the exam-ple 235 × 288.

The different powers of ten of the multiplier are laid out in a horizontal row, the same on which sentences of discursive language are made. The inscription appears as integrated in the sentences, not separated from them. Therefore, the multiplicand seems either to be shaped on a working surface separate from the text – or at least distinguished from usual text – while the multiplier seems to be integrated within discursive text. The space and medium of the working surface in relation to the text that refers to it remains uncertain, paradoxical. There are reasons to believe that in the original text by Pṛthūdha-ka, representations of the working surface concerned a medium different from the one on which permanent text was written. Pṛthūdhaka and the author he comments upon, Brahmagupta, both refer to ‘dust computations’ (dhūli-karman), suggesting that computations were performed either on a dust board, or simply on the bare ground; not on a palm leaf or bark on which manuscripts would have been inscribed in his lifetime.\n",

Could this indicate that for those who copied the manuscripts in the late eighteenth century and onwards, the idea of a separate working surface represented an antiquated form and that in more modern times computations were usually integrated within the text itself? This is a hypothetical historical interpretation, but we might also be misled by thinking about material tools of computation. Perhaps that which is in a capsule represents computations to be committed to memory? We cannot answer these questions, of course, but they do show however that what is represented by encapsulated numerical tables remains undetermined, open to interpretation. Possibly, over time, for different authors and scribes it represented different things. We might then want to retrieve what Pṛthūdaka tells us in the text about the space in which executions are carried out. But here the space of execution and place-value have the same name: sthāna (place/position). This indeterminacy of what place/position refers to, raises questions on the display of intermediary products during the execution of the multiplication.

Although many questions are raised by this analysis, let us retain two main ideas: first, that we need to better understand what encapsulated configurations of numbers represent for our authors and manuscript copiers; and second, in this case, that the order of the steps is not an issue for the commentator who describes the execution, for a degree of latitude is left to the executioner. The intention of the commentator, it seems, might be to explain to the reader some of the steps, not to guide the reader step-by-step in the execution. In what follows, I would like to emphasise how commentaries can display different stages of the working surface while illustrating a same procedure: they may be illustrating possible differences of steps in the execution, but may also testify to different modes of execution. To do so, we will look at two different texts describing the same method of multiplication: precisely the ‘door-hinge’ method (kavāṭa- or kapāṭa- sandhi).\n",

The position and regular shifting of the multiplier obviously have an im-portant role in these methods of execution. When the multiplier moves, the position of the highest digit of the multiplier indicates the digit of the multipli-cand below it on which an intermediary multiplication has to be performed. The procedure to multiply 1296 × 21 in the ‘direct way’ is precisely the one whose execution is detailed in the edited commentary exhibited in Fig. 1. As edited, the displays represent different steps of the execution of the multiplica-tion up to the numerical result. They all seem to belong to the same space as the written text of the commentary.

The inverse order here corresponds to Śrīdhara’s direct order, and what stands as a ‘multiplier’ (guṇakāra) in Board Mathematics is called here a ‘price’ (mūlya), while the ‘multiplicand’ (guṇya) is called ‘the question’ (praśna), which Hayashi translates as ‘<term in> question’.

They both lead to the result, 21528. In Hayashi’s edition, the two tabular displays of the multiplication’s first and pe-nultimate steps, and the result, are given in a capsule. In contrast with what we have seen with the manuscripts of Pṛthūdaka’s commentary dealing with a multiplicand shaped as a ‘cow’s string’, here the capsule seems to separate the numbers from the text, showing that they are in different separate spaces. This suggests that for the scribe at least numbers were made to be inscribed in a space different to that of the running text. The procedure also presents some difference compared to the one in the anonymous commentary on Board Mathematics. As we are given to see the con-figuration when the multiplier is in its penultimate place, all the intermediary products are preserved diagonally over three lines. In the anonymous commen-tary on Board Mathematics, intermediate products are summed into the partial result at each step, and the result appears progressively. It is on the working surface when the last partial product is incorporated into it. In the display given in Śambhudāsa’s commentary, the partial products are each set down, and the last step involves their summing which will yield the result, the product.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ We see that while documenting what the working surface might look like, commentators can choose the moment of the execution they want to display. In all cases, however – and contrary to the assumption for instance of Shukla in his edition of Board Mathematics – commentators do not aim to take us through each modification of the working surface, step by step.

But one may wonder whether between the anonymous commentator of Board Mathematics and Śambhudāsa’s commentary there is not also a difference in the material used to carry out the process. Board Mathematics documents a process in which intermediary steps are progressively erased, as on a ‘dust board’. This is not the case of Śambhudāsa’s process, which is hybrid. Whereas the digits of the mul-tiplicand are progressively erased, as when we use a dust board, the intermediary steps are preserved, just like when we write on paper. Moreover, for whoever has tried to reproduce a ‘door-hinge’ multiplication, the constant movement of the multiplier over the multiplicand raises the ques-tion of the material with which the execution is to be carried out. Whether on paper or on a dust-board, the constant re-writing (and erasing) of the multiplier is indeed tedious. It would be much easier to either leave the multiplier alone (but then we are not technically in a ‘door-hinge’ multiplication anymore) or to execute the multiplication on a gridded space using valued tokens that could be moved around, rather than dust or chalk on a board, or pencil and ink on paper.

Datta’s text is partly a discussion of the philology and possible etymology of the pāṭī, translated with some difficulty as ‘board’. Datta admits that the term is quite late, mentions that it is used for board in vernacular languages of India, and therefore thinks that it is a degraded form of the usual word for ‘plank’ or ‘board’ (paṭṭa and phalaka). He also shows that by the sixteenth century the word was taken to mean rather ‘in succession’.

Datta noted (fol-lowed in this respect by the testimonies gathered by Sreeramula Rajeswara Sarma) that the board was used either with dust and a style, or with a kind of tool which could impart colour to what was often a blackened surface, be it a tablet or even in later times a sheet of paper. This would have been the medium on which ‘dust work’ (dhūlīkarma) was carried out.

All of these are but vague allusions. We note however that certain objects were likely candidates to be used as common computational tools. We might imagine for instance that seeds and grains – which were sometimes also used as beads – could have such a function, since grains as units of capacity and weight are evoked throughout Sanskrit mathematical texts.

The same image is drawn up in the seventh century, in Bhāskara I’s commentary on Āryabhaṭa’s definition of the decimal place value notation. The commentator argues in favour of the notation, evoking the fact that, where many units/shapes (rūpa) might be used to state a quantity, the decimal place-value notation enables such quantities to be stated with less unit/shapes. The term rūpa however is ambiguous, and could refer equally to ‘shapes’ as to ‘units’ noted with symbols.

In eighth- to twelfth-century Bengal, metallic money seems to have been a kind of account money with which computations were made while payments were made in cowrie shells. In this context, cowries were sometimes considered as ‘broken’ money (cūrṇi), together with other ‘dust money’, e.g. dusts or small amounts of gold and silver used as lesser change than metallic coins.

Radhakrishnan, Professor of Sanskrit at Pondicherry University and prac-tising astrologer, Sho Hirose (Tokyo), who filmed him, and Senthil Babu (Institut français de Pondichéry, Puducherry), who was the intermediary between them, I have had access to a film made in 2019 in Puducherry in which Radhakrishnan demonstrates to Hirose how he computes with cauri shells. He notably demonstrates a ‘door-hinge’ computation for a sexagesimal com-putation using cauri shells: as many cauri shells as units. We can see him using the grids used to represent the different cells of a horoscope as a grid for computation. He also uses a big grey shell to represent the number 5 and sometimes 0. Radhakrishnan’s practices gives us an exam-ple of how a ‘door-hinge’ multiplication is applied today by somebody familiar with and from within the live culture of Sanskrit mathematical and astral scholarly lore. 55 Keller, Montelle and Koolakudlu forthcoming; Keller 2015b. 56 Keller 2015b. 57 The terms pāṭikā and pāṭalikā are attested to mean ‘cloth’ in Pali, according to Davids and Stede 1921–1925, https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/pali_query.py?qs=pa%E1%B9%ADalika& searchhws=yes&matchtype=exact (accessed in July 2023). 58 Muthian Vasantha 2016, 336–338. 59 Fuller 2008. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------ The possibilities just tell us that we need not always be attached specifically to the board, nor to the dust.  There is however something more. We may be struck by a feature of the dis-plays of working surfaces in manuscripts. I have suggested above that Sanskrit and even Old Gujarati commentaries of Sanskrit mathematical texts make gen-eral statements about the execution of the multiplications they evoke. The rep-resentations of working surfaces found in manuscripts seem, in the same way, to depict some or all the possible media used. Capsules might be a generic way of displaying many possible working surfaces and the different kinds of numer-ical inscriptions they could involve. As we rethink the execution of multiplica-tions seen above – whether we imagine the execution on paper, on a cloth or a board, with dust, coloured brushes or cauris – the representation of the working surface found in manuscripts represents each one equally and adequately. The multiplicand in a ‘cow’s string’ in Pṛthūdaka’s commentary could be either on a dust-board or on a gridded game-board using seeds. The seemingly hybrid me-dium of the displayed steps of the ‘door-hinge’ multiplication, as found in the manuscripts of Śambhudāsa’s commentary, might be an intentional inclusive mode of representation of different media, different possible ways of executing the multiplication. It is striking that capsules are found in the earliest mathematical manu-scripts that have come down to us and are still in use in the most recent Sanskrit mathematical manuscripts we have studied – some of which were probably written in the first half of the twentieth century. That capsules may be a generic way of representing all working surfaces is but a first approximative hypothesis. Looking back at manuscripts, and at how and whether they really encapsulate ephemeral data such as numerical tables and diagrams, reveals a more complex set of inscriptions. Thus, for instance, we have seen that the manuscript of Pṛthūdhaka’s commentary contains encapsulated and unencapsulated numeri-cal configurations. This is the case of manuscripts we have looked at, which contain a truly wide diversity of ways of displaying configurations of numbers \n",
      "level10\t --------------------|| 64 Experimenting with French high-school children has shown that using tokens like cauris seems easier and appears more ‘natural’ in practice than paper or a kind of erasable slate. Between 2016 and 2019, in a team with Charlotte de Varent, Matthieu Husson and Barbara Jamin, we had high-school students learn different techniques to execute multiplications as found in Sanskrit texts. Among the questions debated with them, was that of the materials with which the multiplications could have been carried out: paper, dust, mentally, with tokens? The ‘door-hinge’ execution was taught directly with tokens, but no one suggested that it could have been used on paper or dust. On the other hand, several students did suggest that other tech-niques could be used with tokens too, notably the multiplicand in a ‘cow’s string’. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------in or out of capsules, in gridded tables or as part of discursive texts. In other words, we need to go back more carefully to our manuscripts to look at the dif-ferent ways in which they represent what would have been a working surface. How generic are these representations? How do they relate to discursive text? What do these diverse ways of representing configurations testify to? More largely, do manuscripts aim at staging many different types of execution?\n",
      "level4\t --------4 Conclusion: back to ideas of performance in relation to the reconstruction of algorithms \n",
      "level9\t ------------------Trying to perform multiplications as closely as possible to those described in manuscripts thus raises questions concerning the media through which opera-tions were carried out. It also underlines how the texts and the manuscripts speak differently about performance, each choosing the image of the continuous per-formance they display and comment on. As we wonder what the aim of Sanskrit mathematical texts was regarding the execution of algorithms, we note that texts seem to point to an idea about the process, its correctness, and its most salient steps, rather than being a normative statement on each of its steps. Moreover, by not focusing on the executions, authors might have been intent on making state-ments that apply to different cases: different ways of noting numbers at times, and possibly different material tools to execute a multiplication. Perhaps there is a voluntary silence about the tools. Using material culture to imagine them makes us realise that this material culture could have changed but the algorithms still make sense. The notation used to represent the working surface can therefore be thought of as being general and generic – in the same way that Sanskrit mathematical sūtras sought to make general procedures that could apply to many different cases, and have many different interpretations. One might argue then that only general or generic elements of the execu-tions are highlighted in treatises and their commentaries, and that the rest may have been left to everything that makes up a performance. At the end of the verse commentary in which Pṛthūdaka comments on the multiplication shaped as a ‘cow-string’, he notes:\n",

Execu-tions could thus be spelled out to explain something about them, but not neces-sarily to provide the ingenious know-how which might also be required to perform the execution. Acknowledgements I would like to thank the organisers of the initial conference and those who produced this edited book, notably Antonella Brita, Janina Karolewski, Mat-thieu Husson, Laure Miolo and Hanna Wimmer, for their inspirational theme and general enthusiasm. My gratitude extends also to P. M. Vrinda for her im-provised performance of Āryabhaṭa’s verses at the conference, Sho Hirose for having granted me access to the film he made of T. P. Radhakrishnan’s perfor-mance, and Radhakrishan’s willingness to share the film and enable us to show it during the conference. I am grateful to the anonymous reviewer who gave me the link to the manuscript of the anonymous commentary to the Pāṭīgaṇita, that I had long wished to examine, and to Liz Carrey Libbrecht whose careful polish-ing of this text has helped in conveying my ideas more clearly and precisely. Karine Chemla repeatedly inspired me to differentiate the medium of writing from the medium of computation when I looked at manuscripts, and the inspi-ration for this paper really comes from one of her fruitful ideas. A first version of the paper was presented in Mumbai in 2019 in a conference which included a homage to Kripa Shankar Shukla whose works I have used so much in my own. Additionally, none of this would have been possible without the careful editions and precise analysis of Sanskrit mathematical texts done by Takao Hayashi. This chapter is a continuation of work I started with Catherine Singh on multi-plications, and evokes the work and sessions we did in high schools with Char-lotte de Varent, Husson and Barbara Jamin. Finally, Takanori Kusuba went out of his way to give me a copy of his oft-cited 2018 article. May he be thanked here as well.

This volume of 192 folios contains mathematical, astronomical and astro-logical works. Amongst them are the drafts and notes of the physician-astronomer himself. This material includes computations, tables and treatises revealing an astronomical programme in which eclipses played a central role. This article attempts to provide a detailed account of the production and pur-pose of the notebook, and endeavours to situate this volume within Lewis Caer-leon’s scientific production and extant manuscripts. New evidence about the life of Lewis Caerleon and his manuscripts are also provided. An analysis of newly discovered evidence retained in the notebook suggests that Lewis Caerle-on’s eclipse writings are mainly based on the works of two little-known fif-teenth-century astronomers from Merton College, Oxford. \n",
      "level4\t --------1 Introduction \n",
      "level9\t ------------------Performance or the act of performing is commonly perceived more as a wit-nessed action, either commissioned or spontaneous, than an introspective op-eration. Reception by an audience thus seems a key aspect of the performance. For that reason, theatre, music or liturgy are particularly well studied under that lens. However, the ‘textualisation’ or mise à l’écrit of the performance or per-formative ritual is essential to explore, whether as a medium of the performance or as part of it. This is particularly true of medieval liturgy, medical and magical charms which need to be sang or pronounced to reveal their force or power. In the case of thaumaturgical or magical charms, the performance needs to be included in a broader set of written instructions preceding the oral ritual.\n",

Once written those narratives become part of a textual tradition, losing somewhat their performative value, but they may be used again by other practitioners. As suggested by Peter Jones and Lea Olsan, performance ‘moved back and forth from oral-aural culture to manuscript, and from manuscript to manuscript or new performance’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------2\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Recent-ly, some studies have broadened the link between performance and manu-scripts or documents, making scribes, authors or readers ‘performers’ of a book, a page or a margin.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------3\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ This broad conception leads to scrutinise again the rela-tionship between performance and manuscript, or rather the intrinsic link be-tween the performance of writing and the codex. Indeed, another aspect implied by the ‘textualisation of the performance’ deserves to be considered here. If one takes performance in its broad meaning of execution, completion or achievement, this certainly encompasses more impli-cations, beyond the strong oral aspect given to the notion. In that case, it is rather the performance of writing which should be considered. Different writ-ings may therefore be lined up on a large spectrum from first notes to finished treatise. This also raises the question of whether an autograph manuscript or a notebook constitutes a performance. Memoranda or other notes written in a volume are rarely intended to be read by someone else than the author. Howev-er, they reveal a wealth of information regarding reading and writing practices. Manuscripts containing informal notes and writings may present different de-grees of achievements. They may include informal notes, preparatory works, drafts or authorial copies.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------4\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Drafts or memoranda were often not intended to survive, their survival is thus haphazard resulting from the fact that they were written on a perennial support. If we consider preparatory works and drafts of a treatise, leaving aside informal notes such as pen-trials, they all represent a certain degree of achievement aiming to the completion of a treatise or another work. Those early steps thus constitute invaluable testimonies of medieval schol-ars at work, but they also are very rare. This is particularly true of medieval astronomers’ autograph manuscripts. Observation and computations records were a necessary preparatory work to be displayed in a treatise or used to com-pute an astronomical table. Quite often, only part of a computation or an obser-vation was to be included in the final text. For instance, Jean des Murs (fl. 1319–1347) refers in his Expositio intentionis regis Alfonsii (1321) to his observation of \n",

      "level9\t ------------------ Computations and observations were means by which the practitioner could predict and ana-lyse an astronomical phenomenon, but they were also made to validate some theories and postulates. Similarly, astronomical canons may also be understood as sets of instructions written to be memorised and to perform a computation.

This material includes computations, tables and treatises and, compared with other extant manuscripts of his, we may clearly detect an astronomical agenda in which eclipses played a central role. MS Ee.3.61 seems to display his preliminary work on eclipses. Considering these different aspects, one may carefully differentiate various pathways of performance: the production per se of the manuscript (by copying or commissioning); eclipse computations and the elaboration of texts and tables. This article attempts to provide a detailed ac-count of the production and purpose of MS Ee.3.61, and endeavours to situate this volume within Lewis Caerleon’s scientific production and extant manu-scripts.\n",

The donation he made in 1490 to Merton College is evidence of his link to this institution. Direct access to sources such as Simon Bredon’s manuscripts (particularly MS. Digby 168), Walter Hertt and John Curteys’s writings, that he plausibly may have only found at Merton College, are other hints of this connection.

      "level10\t --------------------Note that I did not compute those eclipse and parallax tables as precisely as the eclipse ta-bles that I donated to the universities of Cambridge and Oxford.

      "level13\t --------------------------146\n",
      "level10\t -------------------- \n",
      "level9\t ------------------That Lewis claimed the authorship of those tables would seem clear here and might explain why the different references to Hertt and Curteys were erased afterwards. Unless, the verb calculavi refers here to the different corrections he made to the different tables and would also explain the signature ‘Lewys’ ap-plied to every folio. In any event, those mentions show that Lewis’s nove tabule expanse found their ways to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, to which he donated copies of his tables. The ‘twin manuscripts’, MS B. 19 and Royal MS 12 G I, copied after 1485, may have represented one or both donations, though they do not correspond to the donation made to Merton College in 1490. If the ‘twin volumes’ correspond to the donations mentioned in the note, that would mean that Lewis would have come back to his notebook after 1485 to add both notes. It seems highly probable that Lewis made the different donations during his lifetime. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------The genesis of his work is well-represented by this brief passage. It is remarka-ble that in the two notes, Lewis only mentions the eclipse tables that he com-posed, and not the parallax tables based on the Cambridge meridian, which are present in MS B. 19 and Royal MS 12 G I. A short inscription written by Lewis in front of the parallax tables excerpted from John Somer’s book demonstrates that at the time, Lewis had not yet composed his parallax tables based on the Cam-bridge meridian and eclipse tables but was planning to. Indeed, he already stressed the need for a new set of parallax tables, and here again, he points out that the parallax table facing his commentary was mistaken and that despite his editions, some errors remain. The process is very similar to the one observed earlier with Walter Hertt and John Curteys’s compositions. In this note, Lewis explicitly states that he proposed to elaborate a new set of parallax tables based on the meridian of Cambridge and new eclipse tables. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------ The set of eclipse tables elaborated in 1482–1483 is displayed in the three manuscripts commissioned and supervised by Lewis. These tables are derived from Richard of Wallingford’s Albion, more particularly from Book I, Chapters 18, 19 and 21 containing specifically the diameters values needed for computing a part of these tables. Although these tables are displayed in Add MS 89442, pp. 65–71, they are preceded by a similar set of tables, but, this time, based on al-Battānī’s diameters and radii for the Sun, the Moon and the shadow of the Earth, excerpt-ed from Chapters 30, 43 and 44 of his De scientia astrorum.\n",

Although the detailed computation is not displayed, several values were reported by Lewis such as the positions of the Sun and the Moon their diameters, the times of the beginning of the eclipse, its middle and end; the size of the eclipse (expressed in digits); and times of immersion. Interesting-ly, Lewis drew the astrological chart of the eclipse at the time of mid-eclipse, the maximum of the eclipse (figura tempore medii eclipsis). This is the only evidence of his actual astrological practice, though the notebook includes some astrolog-ical tracts and tables. However, as a royal physician, one may assume that he likely practised medical astrology. Indeed, astrological ‘universal’ predictions based on eclipses were mostly employed in astrometeorology and medicine. Lewis Caerleon’s particular focus on eclipses may perhaps be explained by his profession of physician. In any event, the values recorded by Lewis for the solar eclipse of 17 May 1482 in the notebook and in the introductory text of Add MS 89442 agree. The beginning of the eclipse took place at 5:54 pm and the end at 7:42 pm. Those values also coincide with the Cambridge latitude, demonstrating that he em-ployed his 1482 tables based on the Cambridge meridian. The short statement mentioned above where he endorsed Richard of Wallingford’s values was con-ceived as an empirical confirmation.

      "level9\t ------------------Abstract: Most medieval music manuscripts extant today were not used in the performance of music. While the surviving large manuscript codices of relative-ly high production quality have a certain performative capacity as items of pres-tige or cultural capital, the overwhelming palaeographical and codicological evidence points to the difficulties singers would encounter if they tried to per-form from these manuscripts. Addressing questions surrounding the relation-ship of ‘performance’ to ‘manuscripts’, this study focuses on a set of ‘lower-grade’ sources – manuscript fragments of suspected music rolls copied in Eng-land during the thirteenth century – that I argue represent an early stage in the written transmission of the music compositions copied on them. In particular, I shall focus on questions of layout and how their mise-en-page suggests a more ‘ad hoc’ or experimental approach to the copying of their contents compared to the careful planning usually evident in music codices. I propose that close study of these sorts of fragments may bring us closer to the written documents that may have informed some medieval music performances. \n",
      "level4\t --------1 Introduction \n",
      "level9\t ------------------Most medieval music manuscripts were not used in the performance of music. This is true of books of plainchant with music notation copied at and for West-ern European religious institutions since the early tenth century, of the compila-tions of secular song copied throughout Europe in the later Middle Ages and of the collections of polyphonic compositions that proliferated from the thirteenth century onwards. While these large manuscript codices of relatively high pro-duction quality have a certain performative capacity as items of prestige or cul-tural capital, the overwhelming palaeographical and codicological evidence points to the difficulties singers would encounter if they tried to perform from these manuscripts: some of the artefacts are simply too small for more than one or two people to use at the same time, and in many others, not all the voice parts were viewable in the same manuscript opening. Most preserve repertoires that scholars believe were actually composed decades before their extant manu-\n",

      "level12\t ------------------------1\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ \n",
      "level10\t --------------------Indeed, the general structure of the contents of many of these sources (into the early fif-teenth century) argues that they were not compiled for performance, but rather as reposi-tories of important and highly-regarded repertoires […]. [Their particular arrangement in the manuscripts suggests] strongly that the primary intention was to present an organized archive. Such a view is reinforced by the frequent presence of a repertoire that was old-fashioned, perhaps almost obsolete […]. The collected weight of the evidence suggests that they were never intended for use in performance. \n",
      "level9\t ------------------Manuscripts that support this conclusion abound. The most comprehensive source of the Magnus liber organi ‒ the large collection of polyphony associated with the twelfth- and thirteenth-century cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris ‒ is Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Plut. 29.1 (F), a tiny manuscript copied c. 1240 by a single scribe. It has twelve musical staves squeezed into pages that are 232 mm (H) × 157 mm (W) in size.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------2\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ For many of the motet manuscripts copied in the second half of the thirteenth century, the page turns often do not coincide for every voice part. Thus, once the singer of an upper voice part turned a page, the notes for the middle voice or lower voice may no longer have been visible.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------3\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Copying mistakes could make performance impossible, too: while the generally accomplished scribe of the first large (and sumptuously illustrated) collection of Guillaume de Ma-chaut’s music planned the page layout carefully, Elizabeth Eva Leach outlines one example where scribal errors rendered the virelai Dame, a qui unperformable.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------4\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Questions about their use and purpose also arise when beautifully prepared manu-scripts show few signs of wear. Manuel Pedro Ferreira has written of the ‘ambitious political and religious agenda’ that informed the careful preparation of the manu-scripts for Alfonso X’s Cantigas de Sancta Maria. Yet, he notes, considering the four surviving copies that are ‘lightly used’ and the lack of dissemination of the reper-toire beyond Alfonso’s court, the surviving manuscripts seem to reflect Alfonso’s use of written cultural artefacts to promote a particular ideology and political am-\n",

      "level12\t ------------------------7\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ several studies have demonstrated that there are ways into this ‘invisible’ process and that it is pos-sible to uncover some aspects of the prior written transmission of music reper-toires. Addressing the theme of this volume and the specific questions sur-rounding the relationship of ‘performance’ to ‘manuscripts’, I have chosen to focus on a set of ‘lower-grade’ sources here – manuscript fragments of suspect-ed music rolls copied in England during the thirteenth century – that represent (or contain evidence that points to) earlier steps in Haines’s ‘complex writing process’. These English music rolls are generally of a lower production quality than the large retrospective music codices described above.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------8\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ I argue here that the roll fragments represent an early stage in the written transmission of the music compositions copied on them and that close study of these sorts of frag-ments bring us closer to the written documents that may have informed some medieval music performances. While most musicological scholarship previously focused on the sorts of large, high-grade ‘repositories of important and highly-regarded repertories’ described above, more recently attention has turned to less pristine sources. Helen Deeming’s work on the addition of music compositions to English miscel-laneous manuscripts shows scribes experimenting with page layout, for exam-ple.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------9\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Unbound by the usual conventions for copying polyphonic music, their experimental page layouts illustrate their understanding of how music composi-tions can straddle different music genres and forms. In a previous study of fourteenth-century French music notation, I exam-ined a small group of sources, most of which are now fragmentary and of rela-tively low production quality and all of which contained revealing scribal er-rors.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ The mistakes occurred at moments where they either misunderstood the conventions of the older notation or simply slipped up when making the notational conversions to the newer style. What is also noteworthy about this particular group of sources in which I found these errors is that three of the four are rolls (the fourth source, Koblenz, is a fragment, but is likely to have origi-nated from a manuscript codex). These three rolls are listed in Table 1. When the repertoire copied in these rolls is found in later anthologies copied in manu-script codex format, the sorts of discrepancies I documented for these rolls dis-appear – a testament both to the large-scale planning and scribal curation of these larger projects, but also to the uptake and dominance of the new ars nova notation by the time large retrospective anthologies were copied. It is the roll format, then, that attests to the continued use of the older nota-tional style. Extended Franconian notation is found in very few extant manu-script codices and these three rolls are no exception. The scribal errors in these rolls, however, offer clues to the notation in which the exemplars for them were written. Thus, in this case, the prior scholarly focus on manuscripts in the codex format resulted in an incorrect assessment of changes in French mensural nota-tion, which is countered by evidence in the extant rolls suggesting a broader uptake (and possibly a longer period of use) for extended Franconian notations in France. These more ephemeral or at least more disposable sources ‒ the rolls ‒ are probably closer not only to the composers’ original fair copies, but perhaps also to the formats in which new compositions may have been first read and \n",

And does the ex-perimental approach to layout evidenced in these rolls imply they are closer to the beginning of the ‘complex writing process’ that Haines describes for the copying of music and thus closer to a composer’s first writing-down of the music and/or the written artefacts that performers may have used in performance? \n",

The above-mentioned characteristics that determined the use of the roll for other (textual) transmissions – its portability, its lower cost to pro-duce and its dramatic visual rhetoric as a material object – could certainly make it a logical choice for the copying (and performance) of music. In discussing the extent of their use, however, it is difficult to assess the number of music rolls in circulation in the late Middle Ages. The format seems to have been more ephemeral than codices, for example, so music rolls showing signs of wear and tear may have been recycled and repurposed very quickly, especially if they were copied without any lavish decoration or illuminations. \n",

In fact, several features can confirm or at least suggest that the original format was a roll and not a manuscript codex. The most telling feature is, of course, the fragment’s projected original vertical height. In Table 2, three sources (Ob Rawl/B and Ob Rawl/C, PRu 119/A) have projected original vertical lengths of more than 600 mm. This definitively indicates a roll format.

      "level9\t ------------------In addition to these codicological features, scribal decisions with respect to page layout may also be indicative of roll (rather than codex) format. For exam-ple, if there are larger gaps between compositions (that is, larger than the usual space left between individual staves), such as is found in Cjc F.1* and LR 2/261, this is a good indication that the fragment is from a roll. In copying polyphonic codices, the general practice was to first rule the pages with a consistent num-ber of staves per page and consistent spacing between the staves and then to add the music compositions. In rolls, the scribe could draw only the number of staves needed for each composition first, notate that composition and then leave a noticeable gap before later drawing the staves for the next composition. Features of mise-en-page can also reveal aspects of the sources’ function and use, including whether or not they could have been used in performance. In polyphonic codices, music scribes tended to follow certain conventions for situ-ating each polyphonic voice within a manuscript opening. These conventions gradually changed over time. In the earliest motet sources ‒ a genre of composi-tion where the upper voice(s) had more pitches and more lengthy texts than the tenor voice ‒ the convention was to copy the voice parts consecutively. That is, pages were ruled with a single column and each voice was copied directly fol-lowing the previous voice part.

This is the case for Cant 128/62, LR 2/261, Ob Bodley 652, Ob Savile 25, Ob Rawl/B, Ob Rawl/C and PRu 119/B (see the first column of Table 2). A roll with parts copied successively is somewhat different to a codex with voices copied successively as there are no page turns in a roll. So was it possible, then, to sing polyphony directly from these rolls since page turns were not an issue? It de-pends on the vertical height of the roll and specifically on the length of parch-ment that a single composition occupies. In other words, can one or two singers hold the roll open for the length needed so that all the voice parts to be sung are viewable at once? By way of an example, let us first consider the composition notated on the recto of the Ob Rawl/B roll, a three-voice Alleluya setting (Alleluya. Dies sanc-tificatus). Ob Rawl/B is likely to be the longest roll listed in Table 2, with a pro-jected vertical height of 1,054 mm (Fig. 4a shows a reconstruction), and along with Ob Rawl/C, it is also the earliest manuscript, probably copied in the 1240s.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ The Alleluya: Dies sanctificatus (shown in Fig. 4b) occupies c. 400 mm ‒ about one-and-a-half times as long as an A4 sheet of paper held in portrait ori-entation. While a little awkward, it seems possible to hold such a roll so that the three voice parts of an individual composition would be visible to all three sing-ers, although it is difficult to say for certain whether the roll was actually used in this way. Notably, this particular roll has another performance-related feature that is relatively unusual for late medieval polyphonic sources: several performance rubrics annotated in black and red ink. The red ink rubrics are easily visible in Fig. 4b. Indications are given in rubrics written in black ink above the middle voice part, the duplum, and above the tenor to repeat the Alleluya setting after the verse is sung. A red rubric with the word ‘chorus’ (written above the tenor text and music for Super terram) indicates the chorus is to sing this melisma. The final section of the setting is marked by the red rubric ‘In fine’. Finally, an alternative ending to the setting is provided (highlighted with a dotted box in Fig. 4b), also marked with a red ‘In fine’ rubric, and another detailed rubric indicates this alternative ending can be used for shorter performances (‘vel si brevitas ipse deposcit: dicatur sic’). \n",

      "level9\t ------------------The mise-en-page in this setting also exhibits a flexibility that appears charac-teristic of the roll format. The alternative ending (indicated by a dotted box in Fig. 4b) is notated in score format with all three parts stacked one on top of the other in this short three-stave system, and begins after the ending of the tenor, which was squeezed into the beginning of two of the three staves of this system (the ending of the tenor is to the left of the dotted box in Fig. 4b). It is possible that the score format for the alternative ending reflects the mise-en-page of the scribe’s exemplar, but the choice does make sense in this specific instance since all three voices in this alternative ending have the same rhythmic movement and no underlaid texts in the two upper voices. Thus the scribe saved parch-ment by squeezing this passage into a three-voice score format here. Other rolls switch back and forth between music notated in parts and music notated in score format. For example, the recto of Cjc F.1* is notated in two col-umns in parts. On the verso, the first composition (only the ending of which is extant) appears to have been notated in parts, but the second composition, En averil a tens / O Christe clemencie / T. [SUSTINERE] / [Quartus cantus], is notated in a mixture of score and parts (see Fig. 5 where the voice parts of the second composition are labelled; the triplum and motetus are in score, while the tenor is notated as a separate part). Furthermore, the music notation for the top voice (triplum) with the French text was never actually notated, affording us a peak into the process of copying a motet with bilingual texts, where the scribe per-haps had some issues with fitting the music notation to the French text, which was already underlaid. On the other hand, the mise-en-page for Cgc 820/810 seems somewhat wasteful: the recto of the first fragment of this roll has a conductus, Equitas in curia subrogatur, which unusually is notated in parts in a two-column format. The normal mise-en-page for this sort of piece would have been to notate it in score, with the text only underlaid below the lowest voice since all the voices sing the same text. The scribe may have realised their mistake and decided not to continue copying on this parchment: the recto of the second fragment of Cgc 820/810 has the text of another conductus (Fulget in ecclesia) underlaid below the music staves, but the music notation has not been added, indicating that the parchment was discarded in the middle of copying (Fig. 6). The third source in Table 2 that has a two-column ruling of staves is PRu 119/A, but again the scribe modifies this layout as needed: on the recto side of the rotulus, he joins up the two staves to form a single one when necessary to accommodate the tenor part. \n",

That is, they seem to be more ad hoc and similar to the sorts of experimental page layouts that Deeming documents for the polyphonic compositions added to thirteenth-century English miscellanies. But beyond this, mise-en-page in the roll format may have prompted new con-ceptualisations about the relationship between the voice parts in these poly-phonic genres and how the relationships between the voices were formed in their visual (and sounding) instantiations. In his analysis of motet layouts in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Huck proposes a rotulus layout that bridges the two centuries and is indicative of a new conceptualisation of the motet.

      "level4\t --------4 Conclusion \n",
      "level9\t ------------------The rolls considered in this case study are not particularly attractive. All of them are damaged due to their recycling as binding materials or document wrappers by thrifty scribes and precentors once their musical contents were regarded as obsolete.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------31\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Even when they were first copied, they were all of a lower production quality than most extant thirteenth- and early-fourteenth-century music manu-script codices: their parchment is lower grade, initial decoration is mostly ab-sent or infrequent and the text scripts are often not as practised as one might find in contemporaneous books of plainchant or polyphony. The music notation is generally very precise, however. And as described above, there are several instances of scribes making adjustments on the spot or realising mistakes and abandoning projects. While the evidence does seem to point to the possibility of these rolls being used in performance, it is still difficult to say conclusively exactly how they were used. As mentioned above, the iconographic evidence supports their use in the performance of polyphony, and documentary evidence reveals that rolls were also used in other performative contexts as well.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------32\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ These rolls certainly appear to be closer to the act of composition than the large-scale anthologies in which polyphonic repertoires were eventually collected. But perhaps it is also possible to speak of the roll as allowing for an element of ‘scribal performance’, of acts of creativity and skill in the moment-to-moment execution of their craft. To push the metaphor a little further, if organising a collection of polyphonic music can be compared to fashioning a formal performance of a musical reper-toire where the programme is thought out months ahead, the repertoire careful-\n",

With production-level codices, many decisions needed to be made ahead of time. The scribe had to have a plan for the musical genres to be copied, how many voice parts there were, what sorts of texts were to be underlaid and so on. But in the music we find copied on this particular set of rolls, there is evidence of on-the-spot decisions being made repeatedly, based on flow, con-text and trying out new ideas and approaches. The roll allowed the medieval music scribe – and possibly the composer as well – to visualise and ultimately hear polyphonic composition in new ways. \n",

On the contrary, in addition to specialised skills, it also requires choices and anticipation ‘on the spot’. These choices produce variations in the procedure followed and its meaning, as well as discrepancies in the numerical results, which can drastically change the description and com-prehension of the celestial phenomenon under scrutiny. Our approach is to consider one specific manuscript and to reproduce the computations to the best accuracy of our historical knowledge. We show that, as historians, we cannot consider computations in the abstract, disregarding the manipulation of the manuscript, without essential loss of meaning and understanding. On the side of manuscript studies, by highlighting some features of these artefacts and their possible uses by historical actors, we demonstrate the way in which they be-come scientific tools. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------Fifteenth-century astronomers had at their disposal some of the most significant astronomical works from the Hellenistic period, Al-Andalus times, and the Latin Middle Ages. All these astronomical works share a ‘Ptolemaic’ approach, broad-ly construed. They nevertheless differ markedly in some structural details of the geometrical models and in the numerical values of certain parameters on which the computational tools depend. The numerical results they produce are clearly distinct in most cases. Yet despite the circulation of this variety of works in the fifteenth century, the then common practice of astronomical computations was to rely on just one family of such works. This family constitutes what we today call Alfonsine astronomy because these works derive from a table set that had begun to circulate in Latin around Paris, under the name of Alfonso X, king of \n",

      "level9\t ------------------ While a given astronomer could in principle choose to compute celestial positions relying on non-Alfonsine material, those of the nu-merous yearly prognostications and horoscopes produced in this period, and that have been analysed, show Alfonsine positions. It turns out that most of the several hundred astronomical manuscripts pro-duced and assembled during the fifteenth century and extant in patrimonial libraries are ‘toolbox manuscripts’, as described in recent scholarship.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------2\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ These typically consist of texts, numerical tables, diagrams and volvelles (moveable diagrams featuring rotatable parchment discs and threads). Their purpose is not only to propose an astronomical theory and a (mathematical) view of the cos-mos, but primarily to provide the means to execute the long computations re-quired to establish the celestial positions of the luminaries and planets, or to predict the time and number of eclipses. While some of these aggregations were based on the criteria of a book collector, or a librarian, some others can be sin-gled out as being the idiosyncratic deed of an astronomical practitioner, or a group of university masters specialised in astronomy. These manuscripts were often assembled by the astronomers who used them. The use that can be made of such a toolbox manuscript depends on the spe-cialised skills, experience and habits of the astronomers as much as on what the manuscript objectively offers in tabular, instrumental or theoretical content. It stands to reason that the same material consisting of tables and instruments will be used differently, even if the aim were the same, namely, to compute planetary positions. In this paper we argue that hand computation is not a mechanical en-deavour, especially in the case of the long and complex procedures that astrono-mers need to follow. On the contrary, in addition to specialised skills, it also re-quires choices and anticipation ‘on the spot’. These choices produce variations in the procedure followed and its meaning, as well as discrepancies in the numerical results which can drastically change the description and comprehension of the celestial phenomenon under scrutiny. We assume that the use of the same toolbox manuscript by a beginner would certainly have been different to that of an experi-enced expert in astronomical computation, particularly concerning the choices and anticipation. Understanding the non-mechanical dimension of hand computa-tions as they were conducted by astronomers is the main reason why we approach them as a performance. We understand performance here as the execution of a task requiring specialised skills and implying choices which result in significant variations in the process and result of the task. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------For the sake of simplicity, two of the potential sources of variations in the computation procedures and results will not be considered here. Both were probably obvious to historical actors, but bear little or no intentionality on their side. First, one can wrongly execute a given arithmetic operation, thus creating a variation in the computation procedure and probably its result. We will con-sider that astronomers did not intentionally produce this kind of errors, alt-hough this is not to say that their arithmetic rules were the same as ours. In fact, we know for sure that they used other numbers, quantities and arithmetic rules to those of today’s mathematics. It is crucial to our analyses that we follow as closely as possible their arithmetical practices: converting all numbers to a modern format would in many cases erase or deeply transform the choices that astronomers had to make when computing. Second, astronomical computations relied on hand-produced texts, tables and instruments, which can show vari-ants of different sorts in different witnesses. We are not comparing here the results of the same procedure executed with variants of the same tables or in-struments as they may appear in different manuscript copies.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------3\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Of course, a given astronomer could have different witnesses of the same work or even collate different versions of a procedural text or of a numerical table and select one which seemed fit in the context of a given computation. Many of these toolbox manuscripts show traces of such collation processes or even, though more rare-ly, instances of two copies of the same work in the same codex. Our point here is that while astronomers were aware of those discrepancies between manuscript witnesses and had strategies to address them, including explicit strategies of emendation of numerical tables, they would not intentionally create scribal randomness in their computational tools. In this chapter the object of inquiry will be those sources of variation which imply some sort of intentionality lying between the supra-intentional level of the choices of a community (namely that of preferring Alfonsine astronomy against other astronomical traditions), and the infra-intentional arithmetical and scribal mistakes. Such sources include the choice of the computational tools within the Alfonsine tradition; the choice of the procedure to apply with these tools; and the way to handle approximation, interpolation between val-ues, and precision. Our approach is to consider one specific manuscript and to reproduce the computations to the best accuracy of our historical knowledge. Along the way we analyse the various elements of choices left to the astrono-mer’s appreciation, and the various ways in which the manuscript itself – given its material, visual and intellectual dimensions – orients or constrains these \n",

We argue that, as historians, we cannot consider computations in the abstract, disregarding the manipulation of the manuscript, without an essential loss of meaning and understanding. From the point of view of manuscript stud-ies, in highlighting some features of these artefacts and their possible uses by historical actors, we demonstrate the way in which they become scientific tools. From the history of astronomy perspective, we seek a more embedded under-standing of astronomical computations, which constitute one of the central practices of the whole discipline. In the first section we describe the manuscript selected for this analysis and justify our choice: Erfurt, Angermuseum, 3134. The following section is dedicated to the computations of five positions of the Sun and Venus on consecutive days around the spring equinox of 1459 in Erfurt. Each part is devoted to a different computational tool, respectively the Parisian Alfonsine Tables, the Theorice novelle and the Tabule magne (the latter two being included in the manuscript Erfurt, An-germuseum, 3134). These tools, all belonging to the Alfonsine tradition, will be presented in more detail in their respective parts. The Parisian Alfonsine Tables are the most widely used table set of the Alfonsine tradition and we use it as a point of comparison for the other two computation procedures. \n",

This leather and wood structure forms the fifteenth-century binding of a thirty-nine folio codex that combined parchment (fols 1–5, 12–13, 20–21, 27–28, and 32–39) and paper (fols 6–11, 14–19, 22–26, and 29–31).\n",

These prognostications were therefore as much a demonstration of the mathematical, astronomical and astrological skills of those who produced them, as a document for the consideration of the educated public and political elite of those cities. The established tradition of publishing annual prognostications was a rele-vant element of the production context of the manuscript, although not unique to Erfurt and Leipzig. More characteristic of these universities was the fact that the astronomers of this period showed particular interest in a certain type of astronomical instrument. They developed a novel type of equatorium (instru-ment for planetary astronomy) which appeared in these milieus for a few dec-ades before vanishing. They named these instruments that were dedicated to the computation of planetary positions Theorice novelle (New Theories).\n",

This feature of the Erfurt and Leipzig astronomic communities singles them out in the overall late mediaeval astronomical tradition. In most cases, when an active community of astronomers was formed over a few generations of masters and disciples, they usually produced a new arrangement of the astronomical tables, which would become their central contribution.

None of the twenty-four manuscripts that contain parts of the Tabule magne contain a copy of John Lignères planetary instruments. Thus, the close association of the Theorice novelle with the Tabule magne in the Erfurt, Angermuseum, 3134 manuscript is an interesting feature, which somehow revis-its John of Lignères’s initial idea with his work. We will thus follow the path suggested by the manuscript itself and compute positions for Venus and for the Sun using the Theorice novelle and the Tabule magne. This will also be a way to analyse the entanglement of the two tools in this specific context. \n",

This large diffusion began in Paris around the 1320s. While this is the reason why modern scholarship included the word ‘Parisian’ in the title of this table set, astronomers in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were mostly refer-ring to this work with expressions like ‘the tables of King Alfonso’. This points to a second essential historical fact about this table set: the elements originate in Al-Andalus and more specifically from the work patronised by King Alfonso X in the later part of the thirteenth century.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ The exact content of the Parisian Alfonsine Tables is subject to variations from one witness to another. It seems clear, however, that the tables pertaining to the topics of chronology, motions of the eighth sphere, and planetary motions are core elements. The computation of planetary positions with the Parisian Alfonsine Tables followed a series of broad steps, common not only in Alfonsine astronomy but more generally in most of the works available to Latin astronomers. In first ap-proximation, positions were computed as if the planets and luminaries had a constant motion: the mean motion. This provided a mean position which was then adjusted by one or two equations in order to find the true position of the celestial object. The important point in the context of this study is to note that the principle of successive approximations to the target celestial position was deeply inscribed in the logic of the computation. How these successive approx-imations were handled, not only on the level of the individual operations but also more broadly by the design of tools and procedures for computations, is an essential element of the choices that we want to analyse. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------The computation of the mean position itself is broken down into several steps. First, one needs to know the root (radix) of the motions, which is the position of the celestial object at a specific date and place, its initial position. This infor-mation is usually found in the Alfonsine tradition in a dedicated table of roots (radices) for celestial motion. Then one must use a mean motion table in order to know how much the celestial object has moved between the date of the root and the date chosen for the computation. The addition of the root and the mo-tion found in the mean motion table produces the mean position of the celestial \n",

      "level9\t ------------------object. This mean position bears the information concerning the date and place of the computation. If the root is not set for the location for which you compute, you also have to consider the difference of meridians between the two places and add or subtract the mean motion of your celestial object during the time separating the two meridians. Equations must then be applied to the mean position to take into account variations of the celestial object’s velocity. These equations can be additive, if the celestial object happens to be faster than its mean motion, or subtractive, if the celestial object happens to be slower than its mean motion. Equations have a geometrical rationale and do not directly depend on the time and place of the computation. We illustrate this with a volvelle instrument of the Campanus type, clearly showing this rationale (Fig. 2). Note that this instrument is not part of the manuscript we are analysing here, and that we have selected it mainly for convenience, for the demonstration. The first equation, usually known as the equation of centre, depends on the eccentricity of the luminary or planet. You can see the eccentric blue ring on the folio in Fig. 2. The Sun, Moon and five planets have an equation of this type. As the planets and the Moon have a more complex motion they require a second equation, known as the equation of ar-gument. It depends on the position of the planet on its epicycle, which is shown as the red circle on the folio in Fig. 2. This geometrical configuration has an important symmetry around the line joining the planet’s apogee (the place where the planet is farthest from the Earth) and perigee (the place where the planet is closest to the Earth). This symmetry often plays an important role in the design of computation procedures for planetary positions. This is the case of the Parisian Alfonsine Tables one begins by computing the position of the apo-gee which is assumed to share the same motion as the fixed stars. Then, from the difference of the apogee and the mean position one deduces the equation of centre. In the case of the Sun, the computation stops after the mean position of the Sun has been corrected by adding or subtracting the equation of centre. In short, the computation of the solar position comprises the following steps: 1. Take the radix of the Sun. 2. Compute the Sun’s mean position and adjust for your place. 3. Find the difference of the Sun’s mean position and the apogee (previously computed or given). 4. Compute the Sun’s equation. 5. Compute the Sun’s true position by correcting its mean position with the equation. \n",

      "level10\t -------------------- | Matthieu Husson, Samuel Gessner \n",
      "level9\t ------------------In all the other cases, a second correction (equation) is needed. To obtain it, one has to find the mean position of the planet, or Moon, on its epicycle (the dot at the foot of the paper tab on the red disc, Fig. 2), a value generally named the ‘mean argument’ in mediaeval sources. From this value, and the previously calculated equation of centre, one computes the second correction, the equation of argument. The equation of argument depends both on the position of the epicycle (red disc) on the eccentric (blue ring) and on the position of the planet on the epicycle (the dot at the foot of the paper tab of the red disc, Fig. 2). It is thus a quantity dependent on two others. Such a mathematical relation between three quantities is not easily presented in a tabular format. In the Parisian Al-fonsine Tables, as in all tables following the layout of Ptolemy’s Handy Tables, ‘equations’ for the Moon and the planets are presented as five dependent tables (all presented on the same grid and sharing the same argument column): one table for the equation of centre; one for the equation of argument; and three tables to interpolate and take into account the interdependence of the two equa-tions which are named minuta proportionalia (‘proportional minutes’), longitudo longior (‘farther distance’), and longitudo propior (‘closer distance’). It is not essential here to explain in detail how this arrangement of tables works; we simply need to remember that it allows one to take into account the fact that when the epicycle is closer to the Earth, the effect of the planetary position on the epicycle is more important than when the epicycle is far from the Earth.\n",

Venus is approaching its ‘stationary point’ and will soon after begin retrograda-tion, as can be seen with Venus’s position on 14 March. In other words, both the Sun and Venus are near astronomically important points of their trajectory.

      "level9\t ------------------The Theorice novelle instruments were devised in the context of Erfurt Universi-ty around 1450. This type of planetary instrument relies on general principles that are closely connected to those of the above computation with tables like the Parisian Alfonsine Tables. The two-step procedure of determining first a mean position and then one or two equations in order to find the true position is main-tained. The mean position is found from a mean motion table and a root (radix). In the Parisian Alfonsine Tables, the time quantity with which one enters the table, and which corresponds to the amount of time between the date for which the root is fixed and the target date of the computation, is expressed as a sexa-gesimal number of days (and possibly some additional sexagesimal parts of days). This is quite peculiar. In contrast, most of the other table sets in the Al-fonsine tradition expressed this time quantity in calendrical units of Julian years, months, days, and hours. This is also the case of the Theorice novelle in the Angermuseum manuscript. The roots for Erfurt and the (elapsed) year 1458 are also given in small tables. While the mean motion part of the operation is obtained through tables, the equations are found through the manipulation of the volvelles and the reading of their scales (Fig. 3). Relying on several ingeniously designed uneven scales, one first reads an equation of centre from the instrument, and second an adjust-ed equation of the argument, taking into account the varying distance of the epicycle from the Earth (actually changing the size of the epicycle instead of changing its distance). There is a fixed external zodiacal scale serving as a ref-erence for the position of the epicycle on the eccentric. Outside of this scale, a first uneven scale provides the equation of centre. The scale allowing the read-ing of the equation of centre has a step of 1° comparable to the step of the Paris-ian Alfonsine Tables for that quantity. A second uneven scale, with a step of 1, provides the minuta proportionalia and ranges from 0 to 6 on this instrument, while the corresponding table of minuta proportionalia in the Parisian Alfonsine Tables is much more precise, ranging from 0 to 60. Moreover, a centrally fixed moving volvelle can be adjusted with a paper tab, named the almuri, to the fixed zodiacal scale (on the upper part of fol. 3\n",

A second more complex uneven scale associated with a bundle of converging straight lines is spread symmetrically over the volvelle disc. It allows the adjust-ed equation of argument to be read.

Then, on the same folio, one reads from the mean motion of the Sun table, the motion of the Sun for the first two elapsed months of the year, and adds the value of eleven elapsed days to it. This amounts to 1,8;59°. One then has to add the value of the root to the value of the mean motion in order to find the mean position. This produces 5,57;30. However, looking closely at the for-mat of the numbers, the experienced astronomer will be able to deduce that they are expressed in physical signs of 60°, in the fashion of the Parisian Al-fonsine Tables, from which these roots and mean motions were very likely com-puted. The outer scale on the Theorice novelle instruments uses natural signs of 30°. In fact, they are marked with their names (aries, taurus, gemini, etc.) rather than numbered. Thus, before entering the instrument scale, a conversion needs to be performed so that the mean position number depends on the same numer-ation system as the outer scale. Converted to natural signs of 30°, the mean position is 11s 27;30. While this conversion is a rather trivial operation, the scales of the argument on the epicycle of the instrument have a nice layout that mixes the 30° and 60° types of signs.

In other words, when the instruments were designed the apogees were fixed once and for all. They do not share the motion of the eighth sphere and fixed stars as they do in the Parisian Alfonsine Tables. Given the very slow motion of the fixed stars this approximation is of little numerical conse-quence if the instrument is used for dates close to the date for which the apo-gees were fixed.

Given that the two authors have already spent several years exam-ining tables and instruments of this kind, the proposed estimation is certainly informed by this long previous experience, perhaps not unlike an estimation made by the masters using this manuscript in the fifteenth century. Readers are encouraged to make their own estimation and experiment. The values of this equation’s graduation are marked with an ‘a’, indicating that it must be added to the mean position to get the true position. This addition can be done in two ways. The first is by manually moving the almuri by 2;7° in the positive direction and reading the true solar position from the scale at the almuri’s new position. When performing the addition manually (i.e. graphically) it is impossible to achieve accuracy by taking into account single minutes of the equation. Thus, in this case the true solar position obtained is around pisces 29;30. One can also, however, perform the addition arithmetically. In this case the value pisces 29;37° is found. For the sake of comparison with the Parisian Alfonsine Tables we will consider this second more precise value. This again is a subjective choice.

One begins by setting the almuri to the mean position of the Sun, holding the almuri with the ‘epicycle’ volvelle to which it is attached in its position. One then ad-justs the regula to 2,48;15° on the scale inscribed on the rim of the ‘epicycle’. As before, because this scale is graduated in natural signs of 30°, one can convert 2,48;15° into this format, that is, 5s 18;15°. Alternatively, as the signs of 60° are also marked on that scale, one could enter directly with 2,48;15°.  This is the moment when a crucial operation with the volvelles needs to be carefully performed. While the almuri of the ‘epicycle’ volvelle is moved from the mean position of Venus (and the Sun), that is, pisces 27;30, to the true posi-tion by manually/graphically adding the equation of centre 2;7°, it is crucial that the previously set regula be maintained in its absolute position in order to obtain pisces 29;37. This shift will automatically affect Venus’s argument: it amounts to graphically subtracting the equation of centre 2;7° from the mean argument of Venus 5s 18;15°. Although the scale division is not detailed enough, showing slightly more than 5s 16;0°, a trained computer will quickly mentally subtract the numbers and find 5s 16;8° for the true argument of Venus. Once this is done, it is possible to read on the outer scale of the fixed zodiacal ring the minuta proportionalia: 3, in our case. The configuration of the instrument now allows one to use the last uneven scale and read the equation of the argument (Fig. 5). One first looks at which of the three concentric circles corresponds to the minuta proportionalia. In our case, with a value of 3, the central concentric circle is selected. Then from this circle one follows the closest lines in the bundle of straight lines and reads off the equation of argument, finally interpolating by a graphically estimating a value. In our case this produces 28;0° with a sign ‘a’ of addition. The final step is a simple addition of 28;0° to pisces 29;37°, which produces aries 27;37° or simply 27;37° because aries is the first zodiacal sign. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------Examining the positions on successive noons between 9 and 14 March obtained with the Theorice novelle, two things come to the mind (Table 2). First, while the spring equinox occurs between 12 and 13 March as with the Parisian Alfonsine Tables, in comparison the Sun appears to be slightly behind with the Theorice novelle. A more striking difference concerns the behaviour of Venus. While us-ing the Parisian Alfonsine Tables Venus was slowing down in direct motion before reaching a stationary point, the Theorice novelle Venus is neither station-ary nor direct or retrograde but somehow erring randomly between these differ-ent states. Such behaviour cannot be ascribed to the real motion of Venus. In fact, astronomers in this tradition usually assume that the first differences of any astronomical quantity should change slowly and smoothly.

Thus, in all likelihood, Erfurt masters would have identified it as a mathematical artefact pointing to the structural limit of their instrument. Numerically, this erratic behaviour occurs because the order of magnitude of the approximation made during the interpolation operations are similar to the order of magnitude of the variation of the quantity that is interpolated. This occurs when the quantity is near one of its boundaries and when the step of interpolation is too large. This computational phenomenon, we surmise, was probably familiar to many astronomers. However, the cost of overcoming it is high, and there are only two options. First, one can refine the step of interpola-tion, which would require changing the instrument, being able to compute a more precise and accurate value of the target quantity and being able to draw more precise scales. Or, one can try to improve the interpolation procedures themselves to adapt them to these situations, which is a non-trivial mathemati-cal problem. Both of these strategies were adopted by different astronomers, including John of Lignères in his Tabule magne. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------ The Tabule magne adhere to the overall structure of planetary computa-tion: the mean position is determined first, then adjusted with an equation in order to obtain the true position. Unlike the Theorice novelle, they use exclusive-ly natural signs of 30°. Usually, the roots and positions of the apogees are given for Paris in dedicated tables. Interestingly, these tables for the roots and the apogees, not directly pertinent for Erfurt, were not copied in the Angermuseum manuscript. Instead, to use the tables one has to rely on the roots given in the mean motion tables for the Theorice novelle and, on the apogee, values that can be read on the instrument dials. In particular, in this configuration the apogees of the Tabule magne are fixed once and for all, and the approximation inherent in the Theorice novelle will also affect the Tabule magne. This shows that the entanglement of the works contained in the manuscript also impacts the way the computation can be performed. By not including the roots for Paris belong-ing to the Tabule magne, a selection is made, which adapts the toolbox for the location of Erfurt. More prosaically, this will also imply some further number conversion between the systems of natural and physical signs. The main feature of the Tabule magne concerns the treatment of the equa-tions (except for the Sun). Instead of two successive equations which then need to be combined through a complex procedure and the use of three auxiliary tables, John of Lignères prepared a single large double-argument table. The two arguments are the mean centre and the mean argument. Entering the table with these directly gives the values of the equation of centre and the equation of argument combined. These tables are generally presented with steps of 6° for the value of the mean centre (position of the centre of the planet’s epicycle) and mean argument (position of the planet on its epicycle). In the cases of Venus and Mars, however, a step of 3° is used for the argument around the value where the equation of argument reaches its maximum. In other words, John of Lignères, probably tried to avoid or mitigate exactly the kind of numerical phe-nomenon seen in the case of the Theorice novelle. He used the above-mentioned first strategy of mitigation by refining the step of interpolation. John of Lignères also explored the strategy of working on the interpolation procedures. In fact, this was a necessity because no standard practices for double argument table interpolation were explicitly available in Paris during the fourteenth century.

As soon as we consider compu-tation as a practice performed with manuscripts, this insight becomes unavoid-able. One realises that practical astronomers were confronted with a series of choices when performing their computations – choices that depended on the content available in a given manuscript and that often profoundly influenced the result and meaning of the computation. The manuscript we have examined, Erfurt, Angermuseum, 3134, provides us with an illuminating example. At a first level, the physical examination of the document shows that the astronomers who assembled the manuscript deliber-ately chose to entangle two different works, the Theorice novelle and the Tabule magne, into one complex computational tool. This is the first level of choice and agency we have examined. The two works are complementary in many ways. The Theorice novelle are used as a means to adapt the Tabule magne to Erfurt rather than Paris. This is also achieved by not including in their copy of the Tabule magne the specific root tables which would link them to Paris. The Theo-rice novelle can serve to quickly find an approximate position while avoiding any arithmetic beyond addition and subtraction; interpolations are performed ‘visually’. The Tabule magne offers more precise results than the Theorice novel-le and a considerable reduction of computational work, which also reduces the risk of mistakes as compared to the usual procedure with the Parisian Alfonsine Tables. Moreover, including two different tools to find planetary positions in one codex offers the possibility of cross checking and comparing the results obtained by each of them. While the Tabule magne with their double argument tables, completely bypass and transform the understanding of the respective role of the eccentric and epicycle, the Theorice novelle proposes an ingenious graphical-mechanical device to separately analyse the computational influence of each of these two components. The fact that the manuscript affords various different procedures is the sec-ond level of agency that was analysed. Our guiding question here was: how could a fifteenth-century astronomer have proceeded to get planetary positions from the tools available in this one manuscript? What we have numerically explored, represents only a small portion of these possibilities. For instance, one could use the Tabule magne mean motion tables with the volvelle of the Theorice novelle. We have explored neither the effect of alternative interpolation procedures, nor different ways to compute division and multiplication when computing interpolation. Even by limiting ourselves to this rather small set of computational choices, the range of discrepancies between the results and, most of all, their drastic effect on the very nature of the predicted astronomical \n",

It is important to note that these differences appear even if the computational procedures give overall consistent results, usually diverging only within a few arc minutes, in rare cases up to one degree. Fifteenth-century astronomers, when adequately trained, were prepared to handle these discrepancies. They needed continuously to make choices result-ing in discrepancies at this order of magnitude, for instance when doing an addition of numbers given with different precision, or deciding where to trun-cate the result from a division. Instruction texts of different kinds often contain warnings or advice on the importance of these choices. These practices, howev-er, are mostly uncharted by modern scholarship and can only be analysed from the consideration of computations as performance with manuscripts. This high-lights the extent to which performing and interpreting such computations de-pended as much on the document as on the astronomer’s expertise. Undoubtedly, adding more toolbox manuscripts to the analysis, consider-ing more computation scenarios and computing more positions can only in-crease and never decrease the diversity of results and its potential astronomical and mathematical meaning for historical actors. On both levels, the material, visual, and intellectual plasticity of the codex had a central role in allowing astronomers to compose their toolbox. In doing so they entangled tools they had recently composed with others established in their tradition for more than a hundred years, associating tables, texts and graphical elements that could then be combined in many different procedures. This custom-made capacity of the codex then afforded astronomers the oppor-tunity to tailor their toolbox to their needs and to balance the mathematical and astronomical strengths and weaknesses of the different astronomical works they combined.

      "level9\t ------------------Abstract: Bamberg Cathedral, the main church of the diocese founded in 1007 by King Henry II (r. 1002–1024), had one of the most impressive church treasur-ies of the Ottonian period. It was not only endowed with precious liturgical vessels, but also with numerous Gospels books and Gospel lectionaries. Some of these codices were written in the early Middle Ages, well before the foundation of the diocese, whereas other manuscripts were produced around the same time, possibly even specifically for the cathedral and for its consecration. Among the latter are the manuscripts from the scriptorium of Reichenau Abbey. This article addresses the question as to whether the visual organisation of the Gospel books and Gospel lectionaries allows conclusions to be drawn about their use for the reading of the pericopes from the Gospels. In this context, both the primary adaptations already made in the scriptorium by means of signs or special script colours as well as the secondary adaptations like markings are examined more closely in order to work out whether a deliberate orchestration of the manuscripts for special occasions can be discerned. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------Apart from the Palatine Chapel in Aachen and Magdeburg Cathedral, no other church in Western Europe appears to be associated with the Ottonian emperors as closely as Bamberg Cathedral is. King Henry II (r. 1002–1024) founded the diocese of Bamberg in 1007 as part of his efforts to christianise the Slavs along the River Main. The chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg described the circum-stances of this foundation at a synod held in Frankfurt: \n",

      "level9\t ------------------The construction of a splendid cathedral in Bamberg actually began in 1002 before the diocese was founded. When this building was consecrated on Henry’s birthday in 1012, the church was endowed with a precious treasure including liturgical manuscripts such as Gospel books, Gospel lectionaries and sacramen-taries, which were all necessary for the Divine Service. Thietmar mentions that the king assembled all these objects, which were needed to celebrate the liturgy, in Bamberg (‘Omnia autem, quae ad divinum pertinuit ministerium, paulatim congregans’).\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------2\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Some of these manuscripts were commissioned and produced for this church, but others seem to have come from questionable sources. The chronicle of the monastery of Petershausen reports that Henry’s men stole or extorted liturgical books from other churches: \n",
      "level10\t --------------------Sed cum iam dictus rex Heinricus undecumque ex aliis ęcclesiis queque necessaria erant at ditandum et ornandum locum quem construxerat studiosissime congregaret, multa loca rogando spoliavit, quousque locum suum ultra modum ditavit.

      "level9\t ------------------It is very likely that Henry donated other liturgical books in addition to the sto-len and extorted books from his own treasure to ensure his salvation and his own and his predecessors’ memoria. It has often been explained that the re-deeming agency of religious donations in the Middle Ages was particularly ef-fective when these took the form of objects that were used in the liturgy: when a chalice or manuscript with its donor’s depictions or inscriptions was perma-nently before the celebrant’s eyes, the latter was reminded to intercede on be-half of the donor during the prayers and particularly during the canon missae when the donation was in very close proximity to the Blessed Sacrament.\n",

In this study, we will focus on the various Gospel books and Gospel lection-aries from Bamberg Cathedral and the numerous traces of their liturgical use. These codices contain the four Gospels, i.e. four different accounts of the life of Jesus Christ, whom Christians believe to be the Son of God as well as the incar-nate Word of God, according to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Short passages (pericopes) from the Holy Scriptures have been proclaimed and the deeds and speeches of Jesus Christ have been reported during the Divine Service since the earliest Christian times.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ Even if the pericopes that had to be proclaimed were codified exactly, it was still quite difficult to find the particular passage because of the huge corpus of texts in-cluded in the list. As mentioned above, the medieval inventory of the treasure in Bamberg Ca-thedral refers to ‘twelve books adorned with gold and precious stones’ (‘XII Libri auro et gemmis ornati’), and presumably several Gospel books and Gospel lec-tionaries were among them that were either produced for this church or ‘trans-ferred’ to it from other churches. The question here is whether there are any traces of their ‘orchestration’. This rather unusual musicological trope is in-tended to describe the embedding and cues of various Gospel codices in the liturgical year. The Divine Service can therefore be regarded as a series of micro-rituals held throughout the liturgical year with a single score, the different manuscripts being distributed over the whole period of the macro-ritual of the church year. In order to develop a sense of how a manuscript could be custom-ised for the place of its liturgical use, we will first take a look at the Drogo Gos-pels, a Carolingian Gospel book from the middle of the ninth century, which was made for liturgical use at Metz Cathedral. Then the Ottonian Gospel codices from Bamberg Cathedral will briefly be introduced before reflecting on the me-dieval liturgical use of the Gospel books and possible evidence of the ‘orchestra-tion’ and co-ordination of the manuscripts. \n",
      "level4\t --------2 Customising a Gospel book in the Middle Ages \n",
      "level9\t ------------------Before introducing the Drogo Gospels (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Latin 9388), I shall briefly define the different ways of customising a manuscript (besides the inclusion of dedication miniatures). This phenomenon is closely linked to the visual organisation of Gospel books. The visual organisation sub-sumes the mise-en-page of the text and all the visual devices that structure the codex. Since they are multiple-text manuscripts (MTMs) that contain many dif-ferent texts and paratexts all belonging to the corpus of a medieval Gospel book, this set of texts had to be arranged for the original purpose of the codex: the liturgical proclamation of particular pericopes on particular occasions through-out the liturgical year.\n",

While these ways of customising a manuscript are normally original and can be traced back to the scribes in the scriptoria, there are later supplements such as notes, neumes and recitation marks that helped the dea-con who had to proclaim the Gospel to find the right text and gave him an im-pression of how to recite it.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------12\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Furthermore, dedication miniatures often demon-strate that a manuscript was produced to be dedicated to a particular saint and made for a particular church and even a particular altar (Fig. 1).\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------13\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ In summary, then, two different types and ways of adapting a Gospel book can be observed, which will be referred to as primary and secondary adaptation in the following. In the context discussed here, primary adaptation refers to the ‘original’ ele-ments of visual organisation already written down or incorporated in the scrip-torium. In contrast, secondary adaptation refers to making additions like neumes, signs or notes at a later date, usually at the place of use or destination of the codex. The Drogo Gospels, a Carolingian Gospel book written between 845 and 855 in Metz, is an example of a manuscript with impressive traces of primary adap-tation.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------14\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Because this Gospel book has very similar ornamentation and artistic embellishment to the famous Drogo Sacramentary (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Latin 9428), which can be traced back to Bishop Drogo of Metz (801–855/856), the Gospel book is also assumed to have been commissioned by him. As we shall see later, while some Gospel books were probably adapted after their production at the place where they were used for liturgical purposes, the general visual organisation of the Drogo Gospels reflects specific liturgical re-quirements and indicates where the manuscript was (intended to be) used. \n",

Almost all the days of the liturgical calendar and their related pericopes are listed in this index.

Given these findings, it is possible to conclude that this kind of mise-en-page is a reference to the place where the codex was once used since pericopes relating to the relics of Peter and Paul, which were venerated in the cathedral, and relating to the patron saint of Metz Cathedral are emphasised pictorially and graphical-ly. Furthermore, the visual organisation may indicate that this precious book with its very heavy binding was only used on feasts whose pericopes are distin-guished by richly decorated initials and the golden colour of the ink. Unlike the feasts mentioned above, the pericopes proclaimed at Easter, the most important feast in Roman Christianity, did not receive any particular accentuation in the manuscript (fol. 188\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------r\n",
      "level9\t ------------------). The visual distinctions provided by the splendid initials and gold script may have served as effective navigational aids, helping users to identify both the beginning and the end of the pericopes. We should keep in mind, however, that Metz Cathedral, where the Drogo Gospels were used, was illuminated by candles during Mass, especially during the Christmas Vigil, so it is questionable whether the text written in golden ink could have been read at all in the flickering light. It is also possible that the pericopes were recited by heart and the shimmering characters in the open book were subsequently pre-sented to the faithful. This emphasis may also stress that the Word of God, Jesus Christ, whose incarnation is commemorated liturgically at Christmas, is codified in the Drogo Gospels.\n",

Unfortunately, the written sources – such as the aforementioned inventory of the treasure or a list with missing pieces from the treasure from the second quarter of the twelfth century – do not provide any detailed information, but just say ‘Libri auro et gemmis or-nati’ (‘Books adorned with gold and gems’),\n",

If we now consider the extant manuscripts that are known to have been in Bamberg Cathedral around 1030, we will find eight Gospel codices and two Gospel lectionaries. Both types of books contain the four canonical accounts of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. But while the Gospel book in-cludes the four Gospels in their entirety, the Gospel lectionary only contains the pericopes read during the Divine Service, the Mass, arranged not in the order in which they appear in the respective gospels, but mostly in the sequence in which they are read during the liturgical year.\n",

In other words, is it possible to conclude that there was a particular distribution of the codices in their ritual use over the liturgical year by analysing the customisations in the visual organisation of the Gospel books (both the primary and the secondary adaptations)? And given that five Gospel codices were presumably produced once the diocese had been estab-lished and the construction of Bamberg Cathedral had already begun, are there any references to the place where the commissioned codices were to have been used in the liturgy? Since the Divine Service only includes one proclamation of a single Gospel pericope read from one codex, it is unlikely that all these Gospel codices were used in a single Mass. It is possible, however, that the other Gospel books that were not used that day were arranged on an altar or were on display elsewhere. There is pictorial evidence of baroque arrangements of the cathedral treasure during solemn services.

Even if the arrangement depicted is an early medieval practice, the Goldene Tafel, which is the main altarpiece of the abbey church of St Michaelis in Lüneburg and was produced around 1420, documents that Gospels with splendid bindings were also incorporated into this kind of accumulated treasure ensemble in the Middle Ages.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ In the case of Bamberg Cathedral, there are no lists that specify a particular manuscript had to be used on a particular day of the liturgical year. The liturgi-cal embedding of the codices cannot be traced back to any other written sources either. Nor do the cathedral’s various Gospel books themselves possess any entries that might give us some explicit hints as to their use during the Divine Service. Written sources such as lists of pericopes recorded in codices actually existed in medieval times. One of them was noted down on the pastedown on the front cover of the Gundis Lectionary (St Gall, Stiftsbibliothek St. Gallen, Cod. Sang. 54) produced at St Gall around the year 900 and very probably donated by a woman called Gundis, as the textile fragment that was pasted underneath the list indicates (Fig. 4).\n",

While the texts in the lectionary are written in a Carolingian minuscule script, the script used for this entry is a Ro-tunda, which was used in the high Middle Ages. Thus we can conclude that this short list is a supplement that was added a long time after the manuscript was originally produced. It therefore appears that only a few pericopes were read out of this precious manuscript at the time the short list was written. This is all the more remarkable since the manuscript, being a Gospel lectionary, only contains the isolated sections that were proclaimed during the liturgical year. The entry proves that the Gundis Lectionary was actually used in the liturgy – at least in the high Middle Ages. This evidence is significant because it is often doubted that precious Gospel books were used at all for the proclamation of the Gospel in the liturgy, as there are rarely traces of codices having been adapted for prac-\n",

      "level12\t ------------------------28\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Conse-quently, the liturgical use of these codices has often been negated completely, some scholars arguing that the codices were exclusively used as a ritual and mate-rial substitute for Jesus Christ in the liturgy that was incensed, kissed and put on the altar like on a throne.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------29\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ After analysing written sources for the Byzantine read-ing practice of the Gospel pericopes in the liturgy, Rouwhorst counters that lectio continua was the dominant way of proclaiming these passages in Eastern Christi-anity. Therefore this practice of reading the Gospels ‘made liturgical instructions superfluous’,\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------30\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ as can also be assumed for Latin Late Antiquity and the early Mid-dle Ages. Thus the lack of paratextual instructions is not a clue about the non-liturgical embedding of the codices, but can be interpreted as a sign of a past reading practice and a hint of the liturgical use of the codices for the proclamation of the Gospel. In the case of the Gundis Lectionary, it is also significant that the woven textile strip bearing the name ‘Gundis’, which is probably contemporary to the codex, was cut out and attached to the pastedown in the front cover of the lectionary in later times, suggesting that the donor was meant to be remembered and explicitly made present during the liturgy even centuries after donating the manuscript. The list of the feast days on which this book was supposed to be used is therefore in close proximity to the textile bearing Gundis’s name, which reminds the reader (the deacon or the celebrant of the Mass) to pray for her. The Gospel codices of Bamberg Cathedral may also have been used in accordance with the medieval teaching of memoria. In the Middle Ages, liturgical vessels and codices were donated in order to save the donor’s soul after their death and benefices were installed to celebrate Masses for the redemption of the donor. Since it was believed that donated chalic-es, patens, altars and manuscripts especially unfolded their redeeming agency when they were used in the liturgy, it is likely that the use of precious manuscripts such as the Gundis Lectionary was not an exception, but rather the rule, at least on a few choice occasions during the liturgical year.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------Although there is no written information on the use of the different Gospel books of Bamberg Cathedral, it may still be possible to reconstruct the liturgical use of the Gospel books and their ‘orchestration’ and coordination from their visual organisation and possible customisation (primary and secondary adapta-tion). Since some of the manuscripts from Bamberg Cathedral predate the church’s foundation in 1002 and its consecration in 1012 by up to 200 years, not all of them can display original traces of visual organisation that reflect the liturgical requirements of the Ottonian cathedral and its sacred topography, such as the various altars dedicated to saints that were particularly venerated in this church. The older manuscripts seem to have been acquired for the recently built church, while others are likely to have been commissioned and may there-fore show traces of primary adaptation or a reference to the intended place of use. When looking at possible ways of highlighting a pericope beyond the indi-ces like the breviaria/capitula and the Eusebian sectiones, which are part of the regular indexing systems of a medieval Gospel book, one therefore has to differ-entiate between the original, contemporary structuring devices beyond them (primary adaptations) and later additions and supplements (secondary adapta-tions).\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------32\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ As for the former, medieval scribes regularly used different kinds of scripts, colours and sizes to organise the contents of manuscripts visually. In any given scriptorium, scribes created a panoply of stylistic and graphic devices to highlight pericopes and indicate the hierarchical relationships between texts. In general, finding the right pericope for a particular occasion in a medieval Gospel book is far from straightforward. The manuscripts regularly include a list called the Capitulare evangeliorum. Usually located at the end of the codex, this lists the feast days with their corresponding pericopes from one of the four Gos-pels. Very often the name of the feast or the day of the ecclesiastical calendar is mentioned first, frequently followed by the Roman church where the Papal Stational Liturgy was celebrated that day.\n",

Since this in-dexing system is not easy to handle, the scribes sometimes added further struc-turing elements as well: they used various marks, sometimes even rubricated ones, such as little crosses in order to indicate the beginning of the pericope and little F, FIN or FINIS marks in order to indicate the end of it (Fig. 5). In most cases, these marks can be traced back to a specific scriptorium, but some signs were squeezed in between characters, so it is likely they were added later.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------35\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Written by the scribes who produced the original manuscripts, these marks may or may not be signs of primary adaptation for their use at a particular place as it is possible the scribes copied the marks from the codex they were using as a model.

      "level9\t ------------------ In contrast, neumes above the lines of the text, words of the initial formula such as ‘In illo tempore’ (‘At that time’) with which the pericope to be recited begins in the margins, scrawls indicating the beginning or end of a pericope, and recita-tion marks all appear to be later additions in the vast majority of cases. As far as the Gospel books of Bamberg Cathedral are concerned, evidently, only those among the manuscripts at Bamberg Cathedral that were produced around or after the construction and dedication of the cathedral can show origi-nal traces of customisation for liturgical use at Bamberg. So only those codices that contain signs added in the scriptorium may have been intended for their orchestration or coordination from the outset. Thus, the ninth- and tenth-century Gospel books may have been adapted for ritual use in Bamberg later and for their incorporation in the ensemble of manuscripts there. While it is impossible to fully reconstruct the score of the liturgical manuscripts of Bam-berg Cathedral, some traces can be found of the embedding of particular Gospel books and Gospel lectionaries in the various Masses that were celebrated in this church.

If there are any later accentuations or supple-ments, however, the particular codex was presumably used or was at least in-tended to be. One example of the customisation and arrangement of a Gospel book is found in Msc.Bibl.93, a Carolingian manuscript that was written in Lorsch in the second quarter of the ninth century. On the whole, this manu-script was produced very carefully, but there are no miniatures of the evange-lists in it or any other illustrations or elaborate canon tables. It is only the four incipit and initial pages that show a certain accentuation of the beginning of each Gospel by way of a Capitalis script. There are at least 169 highlighted pe-ricopes in this particular manuscript, however. One can often find small rubri-cated crosses in the margins indicating the beginning of a pericope, and the end of almost every section is marked by a rubricated F, a FIN or a FINIS (Fig. 5). While most of these marks were incorporated into the text during the process of writing, a number of them must have been added later as some FINIS marks have virtually been squeezed in between two words. If we compare the 169 ac-centuated pericopes in the codex with the edition of a Capitulare evangeliorum compiled by Theodor Klauser and listing up 297 pericopes, more than half of the sections contain signs that were added to prepare the manuscript for the ritual proclamation of the Gospels. The highlighted pericopes mark the sections to be read on the most important feast days, like Easter, Pentecost and Christmas, but there are also a considerable number of marks for the Masses celebrated during Lent and on minor feast days. Since this manuscript, which is plain in appear-ance compared with the famous Ottonian Gospel books, long predates the foundation of Bamberg Cathedral, however, it is almost impossible to deduce the liturgical use of this codex in Bamberg. The later supplements like the squeezed-in notations may have been inserted at the scriptorium as secondary adaptations, in the vicinity of the church where the manuscript was used at first or even in the scriptorium of Bamberg Cathedral. Further research needs to be done in order to classify the different marks and establish whether they are primary or secondary adaptations. Considering the modest appearance of this Gospel book and the existing marks in the work, it is likely that the codex was used in Bamberg Cathedral on days that were not the most important ones in the liturgical calendar. If that was the case, the canons may have used this manuscript for the occasions that called for the reading of the pericopes that had already been highlighted in the codex anyway. \n",

There is a striking way of marking the beginning and end of pericopes in this codex: by using signs that look like crosses or wild scrawls in the mar-gins of some of the folios. Having been scratched into the plain white parch-ment with a stylus, these marks probably represent devices added later to ar-range the codex for liturgical use. Again, it is unclear where these indicators were scratched in the book – at the former place of use or in Bamberg. Unfortu-nately, a look at the pericopes highlighted in this Gospel book cannot provide any further clues to the embedding of the codex within the ‘orchestra’ of manu-scripts at Bamberg Cathedral because the highlighted pericopes belong to major feasts (Epiphany and Easter) and three feasts commemorating saints (Innocent Children, Simon and Jude, and John the Apostle). Since the feast of Simon and Jude is the only one not highlighted in another codex, this Gospel book may have been used on that day unless these signs are remnants of the liturgical use in the church to which this codex originally belonged. Msc.Bibl.94, the Ottonian Gospel book written and illuminated in Cologne around 1030, is a lavishly illuminated manuscript with resplendent initial pages and a carefully executed visual organisation; every paragraph initial indicating the beginning of a Eusebian section is written in a golden majuscule script, for instance. In addition, recitation marks were added to several pericopes in this Gospel book as well as the particular formula for the beginning of their liturgi-cal proclamation. The pericopes thus highlighted in this codex are those read on the most important feast days, such as Christmas, Ascension and Easter. In the Breviarium Eberhardi Cantoris, a Liber ordinarius from the middle of the twelfth century that codifies the characteristics of the liturgy at Bamberg Cathedral, Eberhard, a cantor of Bamberg Cathedral, describes a rite after the communion during the Mass at Christmas Eve: ‘sacerdos ascendat chorum precedentibus candelis et turibulo et legat ewang. Liber generationis’ (‘a priest walks up the sanctuary while candles and a censer are carried before him, and he proclaims the Gospel Liber Generationis’).\n",

While we cannot deduce that this was the only Gospel book used for the proclamation of this passage, it is likely that it was once embedded in the Christmas liturgy. Although this pericope was also read during the liturgy of hours on minor feast days, the accentuation of the passages to be read on important occasions speaks in favour of this. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------As the accentuation of pericopes suggests, a survey of the Gospel codices of Bam-berg Cathedral shows that further manuscripts were likewise produced or later adapted to be used on particular feast days (Table 1). While the pericopes for the major feast days are highlighted in several of the manuscripts, others such as the passage for the feast of the Pentecost Vigil are only emphasised in one codex. It is therefore possible that this Gospel book was, indeed, used for the proclamation of this passage at Bamberg Cathedral. This conclusion is tentative at best, however. If we turn to the three manuscripts produced at Reichenau Abbey, though, all of which are known to have been donated to Bamberg Cathedral by Henry II, but were not – as the Gospels of Otto III (Clm 4453) suggest – commissioned for this church, the impression changes. The two Gospel books and the lectionary include two codices with accentuated pericopes for a particular feast. The Reichenau man-uscripts seem to have been coordinated in a sophisticated way, rather like music in a score. This is particularly noticeable as the older Gospels of Otto III (Clm 4453) written for Henry’s predecessor shows evidence of both primary and secondary adaptation: rubricated crosses that mark the beginning of some reading sections are evidently part of the original production process, while other pericopes were marked by small crosses in dark brown ink (this was probably done later).

      "level9\t ------------------The famous Pericopes of Henry II (Clm 4452) contains several narrative minia-tures depicting episodes from the life of Jesus Christ. Each of these scenes ac-companies the pericope that was read on important feast days related to Jesus Christ, beginning with Christmas and ending with Pentecost. These miniatures occur in the cycle of the liturgical year and follow the Temporale after Christmas and Epiphany, which have fixed calendar dates. The Temporale codifies the movable Christian feasts (Maundy Thursday, Easter, Assumption and Pente-cost). Three further miniatures illustrate key events in the life of the saints (John the Baptist, Peter and Paul, and the Virgin Mary) and appear in the order given by the Sanctorale, which codifies feast days with fixed dates. One of these shows the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, which is based on the apocryphal texts of the Transitus Mariae, while the other two depict events that are described in the New Testament. There are two more narrative miniatures as well. The first one, showing the vocation of Zacchaeus the tax collector and the banquet in his house, follows the pericope for the dedication of the church (fol. 200\n",

Instead of containing the whole text of the four Gospels, the Pericopes of Henry II only contains 194 pericopes, which had to be proclaimed in the particular Masses during the liturgical year.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------39\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Various pericopes were endowed with lavishly decorated initial pages, and sometimes even with title or incipit pages. The structure of this codex facilitated a particu-lar mode of incorporating the miniatures: the first part of the Gospel lectionary with the Temporale and the fixed feasts relating to Jesus Christ exhibits a picto-rial cycle that follows the chronology of the life of Jesus. The question of wheth-er the distribution of miniatures can be attributed to the liturgy and to the pe-ricopes that were – or were originally intended to be – proclaimed from this manuscript cannot be answered with any certainty. In fact, it is not even clear whether this codex was used in the liturgy at all, as there are neither obvious signs of use nor any recitation marks or later accentuations or supplements. Thus, the miniatures could also have served as an aid to finding the correspond-ing pericopes for the most significant occasions and feasts in the church year. By comparing the highlighted pericopes of the major feast days in the Peric-opes of Henry II with those in the other two manuscripts from Reichenau Abbey, however, we can see that the former supplements the latter manuscripts well. In particular, the passages for the first High Mass on Christmas Day (In gallicantu) and the pericopes for the feasts of Candlemas, Ascension and Pentecost, which are especially emphasised by full-page and double-page miniatures in the lec-tionary (Fig. 8), are not highlighted at all in the two Gospel books. It is therefore conceivable that this manuscript was used on these days and was possibly car-ried through the church, displaying the colourful miniatures to the congrega-tion in order to indicate the meaning and biblical background of the particular occasions. Henry II may have commissioned these Gospel codices (Clm 4452–Clm 4454) as supplements to the older manuscript (Clm 4453), which was prob-ably commissioned by or for his predecessor. The endowment of Bamberg Ca-thedral with two precious new manuscripts, both written in the scriptorium of Reichenau Abbey and closely connected stylistically, also suggests that the visual organisation of these codices was coordinated and harmonised inten-tionally.     \n",

      "level9\t ------------------Returning to the whole ensemble of Gospel codices at Bamberg Cathedral, an analysis of the highlighting of the pericopes proclaimed on commemorative saints’ days shows that these passages are not usually highlighted in particular Gospel books. The most important feasts are highlighted in different manu-scripts, however. This again indicates that the various Gospel lectionaries and Gospel books may have been used on different occasions and therefore custom-ised in specific ways. Once again, the three codices from Reichenau Abbey seem to be particularly well harmonised in this respect. Regarding the Carolingian Gospel codices written before Bamberg Cathedral was planned or constructed (Clm 4451, Msc.Bibl.92 and Msc.Bibl.93), further investigations could answer the question of whether the accentuations they contain are primary adaptations from the ninth century or secondary ones that may have been incorporated in Bamberg. In addition to the feast days of the saints, the Lorsch Gospels (Msc.Bibl.93) contains numerous highlighted pericopes for the Masses held on weekdays (feria). We can therefore assume that it was intended for use on more ordinary days, while the particularly precious codices only left the treasury on the major feasts. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------When investigating the extent to which the Gospel books were customised for their intended place of use, we need to consider the sacred topography of Bamberg Cathedral, which describes the spatial and ritual setting in which spe-cific saints were venerated. Some relevant information may be gleaned from the Capitulare evangeliorum. This list codifies the pericopes that were to be recited during the Masses in the course of the liturgical year, including the feast days of the saints. Although the liturgy of the most important feasts and the commemo-ration of the majority of the saints were prescribed by the Roman model of the Capitulare evangeliorum, the veneration of the saints differs slightly from one church to another. Some saints were only venerated in a few dioceses or churches as their importance was limited to a small region. The high altar of a church was frequently dedicated to a patron saint, whose relics were deposited within the altar in most cases, an act that gave the altar particular dignity. The specific ‘personnel of the saints’ of a church was also reflected by the Capitulare evangeliorum, as it contains augmentations according to local conventions or rites. In the case of Bamberg Cathedral, contemporary sources report the pat-ronage of specific altars within the Ottonian cathedral.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------40\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The high altar in the western sanctuary was dedicated to the Holy Trinity, the Holy Cross, Peter and Paul, all the Apostles and to Kilian and his companions, for example. The high altar in the eastern sanctuary was dedicated to Mary, Michael, the Heavenly Hosts and George. The altar of the Holy Cross in the main aisle of the cathedral was additionally dedicated to Stephen, the protomartyr. Apart from the Franco-nian saint Kilian and his unnamed companions, there are no saints of particular local importance here. Looking at the other altars, we can find common Roman saints such as Gregory, Sylvester, Lawrence, Vitus and Hippolytus, but there is one altar in the eastern part of Bamberg Cathedral that mainly ‘gathers’ local saints from Bohemia, such as Adalbert of Prague and Wenceslas, as well as saints from Regensburg, such as Emmeram, Erhard and Rupert, the first bishop of Salzburg. While the Roman saints are regularly included in the Capitulare evangeliorum of the Gospel books of Bamberg Cathedral, there are no instruc-tions there regarding the pericopes for the feast days of the local saints. Looking at the pericopes assigned to these saints in the respective Gospel books, we cannot trace any augmentations or supplements indicating the beginning or end of a pericope either. In sum, then, any reference to the particular sacred topography of Bamberg Cathedral appears to be absent in the Gospel books and their visual organisation. The Gospel lectionary written at the Abbey of Seeon (Msc.Bibl.95), however, does provide some evidence of customisation to ac-\n",

      "level12\t ------------------------41\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The mentioning of Willibald, Wunibald and Walburga suggests that the manuscript was originally intended to be used in the diocese of Eichstätt, where these saints are buried and venerated, or it belonged to a church in that diocese and was transferred to Bam-berg later (perhaps at the behest of Henry II) without erasing the entries on the locally venerated saints at the place of its subsequent use. \n",
      "level4\t --------5 Conclusion \n",
      "level9\t ------------------In this study, we have investigated evidence of the use of Gospel codices in the liturgy and the material traces of their incorporation in the Mass. These traces in the particular manuscripts suggest that the nine Gospel books and Gospel lec-tionaries from Bamberg Cathedral might have been subtly coordinated or ‘or-chestrated’ by means of their visual organisation. On the one hand, there are primary adaptations to arrange a manuscript like (narrative) miniatures, using different types, colours and sizes of scripts that might accentuate particular pericopes. On the other hand, one can find secondary adaptations like signs and glosses scratched with a stylus or written in brown ink to indicate the beginning or end of a passage (crosses and F, FIN and FINIS notations), plus neumes and recitation marks. Since these signs can often be spotted in the Carolingian Gos-pel books, we should bear in mind that it is still unclear whether these traces of customisation were added in a scriptorium or elsewhere later on. An exact clas-sification of the particular traces of customisation is impossible with the naked eye (except for the miniatures and scripts executed in the scriptoria). Non-destructive material analysis may eventually provide further insights on the accentuation of pericopes and the integration of the manuscripts in the Roman Mass. Therefore, in the absence of a medieval register codifying the coordina-tion of the manuscripts, any deduction regarding an extensive ‘orchestration’ of all nine Gospel codices of Bamberg Cathedral must remain tentative. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------In the case of the three Reichenau Gospel codices, at least, the results of the material investigation might provide some clarity. Since Clm 4452 and Clm 4454 in particular are closely related stylistically, it seems likely that they were writ-ten in close temporal proximity or even simultaneously. The visual organisation of the codices and the accentuation of the pericopes can be traced back to the scriptorium as primary adaptations. In addition, the Gospel codices and the Gospel lectionary produced at Reichenau Abbey do not possess any secondary adaptations such as recitation marks or neumes. Perhaps the existing arrange-ment was either sufficient for the liturgical use of the manuscripts or the Gospel codices were considered too precious to be adapted by making additions and subsequent customisations.

      "level2\t ----Reading the Psalms: The Relationship between Visual Organisation and Ritual in Medieval Latin Psalter Manuscripts \n",
      "level9\t ------------------Abstract: Medieval Latin psalter manuscripts are closely linked to religious practices such as the Divine Office and private devotional practices. The core of these ritual practices were the biblical psalms contained in these manuscripts. However, the use of psalter manuscripts presents some challenges to the own-ers: access to certain psalms or groups of psalms was particularly important, for example, but, unlike modern books, medieval psalter manuscripts usually do not contain page numbers or running titles that would make it easier for the users to find their way through the manuscript. Nevertheless, a closer look re-veals other aids that make it possible to find certain sections or highlight indi-vidual psalms. This article examines the correlation between the visual organi-sation and the (potential) use of these manuscripts in the Divine Office. \n",
      "level4\t --------1 Introduction \n",
      "level9\t ------------------During the Middle Ages, psalter manuscripts played an important role in vari-ous areas of daily life. For one thing, they were used in monastic learning; to be psalteratus, i.e. to know the psalter by heart, was, as Carol Gibson-Wood among others states, ‘synonymous with knowing how to read Latin’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------1\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ It was not only in the context of monastic learning that psalms were of great importance, but in Christian liturgy – the Divine Office – and in private devotional practices, too. The Divine Office, nowadays largely known as the Liturgy of the Hours, is a Christian practice that, as Jonathan Black puts it, ‘served as the liturgical fulfil-ment of the scriptural precepts exhorting the faithful to pray at all times’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------2\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ As a result, eight services structured the course of the day and night. The celebration of each of the ‘hours’ – as the services of the Office were called – took place at a \n",

On the different roles of psalms in daily life, see Gross-Diaz 2012, 441–442. 2 Black 2001, 45. The scriptural precepts are found in Luke 18:1, 1 Thess. 5:17, Eph. 6:18 and Heb. 13:15. \n",

Each of these services had at its core the reciting of psalms; over the course of a week, the complete biblical Book of Psalms had to be recited, which consists of 150 psalms.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------3\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Apart from the psalms, other elements, such as canticles – songs or hymns whose texts come from oth-er books of the Bible – and scriptural lessons were integral parts of the Divine Office.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------4\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ In the Latin Church, the two predominant cursi were the secular (or non-monastic) and the monastic; they are similar on the surface, but differ in some respects, such as the distribution of psalms over the week. The secular cursus ends with Matins on Saturdays, for example, during which Psalms 97 to 108 were recited. In contrast, the monastic cursus, which is based on the distribu-tion of psalms in the Rule of Saint Benedict (sixth century), requests monks to recite Psalms 101 to 108 in Matins on Saturdays.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------5\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ There are numerous manuscripts that only contain the Book of Psalms, but not the other books of the Bible.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------6\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ One such type of medieval psalter manuscript is the ‘biblical psalter’, in which the Book of Psalms is sometimes presented in more than one language or with glosses; these manuscripts were primarily in-tended for study, not for prayer.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------7\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ This paper focuses on a different type of psal-ter manuscript, however, namely the liturgical psalter. The term ‘liturgical’ already indicates that this type of manuscript is closely connected to Christian worship, and this also includes manuscripts made for private devotional prac-tices. Apart from the 150 psalms, liturgical psalters include textual material that \n",

See also Hughes 2004, 231–236; Dyer 2012, 664–670. Two tables outline the details of Matins on Sundays in the secular and monastic cursus in Billett 2014, 21–22.

For a detailed differentiation of the monastic and secular cursus, see Billett 2014, 13–77. See also Harper 1991, 73–108; Black 2001, 51–61; Hughes 2004, 50–80. 6 Lucy Freeman Sandler points out that ‘as early as the sixth century the 150 biblical psalms were extracted from the Old Testament to constitute a separate text’; Sandler 1999, 16. See also Gross-Diaz 2012, 441. There are three substantial Latin versions of the Book of Psalms: the Gallicanum, the Romanum and the Hebraicum. On this matter, see, for instance, Leroquais 1940, xiv–xl, esp. xxvii–xxxvi; Gross-Diaz 2012, 427–430; Rankin 2017, 279–281.

Victor Leroquais gives several examples of such biblical psalters. He argues that some manuscripts were, in fact, used liturgically. See Leroquais 1940, xliv–li. \n",

      "level12\t ------------------------8\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Liturgical psalters are also usually preceded by calendars and can include prefatory miniature cycles, richly ornamented initials or lavish marginal illustrations, just like psalters in general.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------9\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ As indicated above, psalter manuscripts do not normally contain all the texts needed for the Divine Office; additional manuscripts were needed in order to pray the different hours. An antiphon (a short text) was sung before and after most psalms, for example.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------10\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Antiphons were seldom included in psalter manu-scripts, but were sometimes added by a later scribe who wrote them down in the margins. To perform the Divine Office, an additional manuscript was therefore required that gathered these chants: the ‘antiphonary’. Other books were also needed, such as a lectionary containing the biblical readings that were also part of the hours. These two examples alone show that several essential elements for the Divine Office generally are not part of psalter manuscripts. Many of the manuscripts discussed below were written at a time when two more user-friendly types of books already existed: firstly, efforts to combine the elements of the Divine Office in a single manuscript led to the development of the brevia-ry, a type of liturgical book for the clergy,\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------11\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ Despite the develop-ment and increasing popularity of these two types of books, psalter manuscripts continued to be produced in large numbers throughout the thirteenth and four-teenth centuries. Psalter manuscripts contain at least 150 texts – the psalms – and a few other texts such as the canticles were usually added as well. Due to the amount of \n",

Sandler mentions a third type of psalter – the ferial psalter – that has an even closer relation to ritual use. In addition to the materials contained in liturgical psalters, these also include ‘invitato-ries, antiphons and versicles that are chanted in conjunction with the recitation of psalms’; Sandler 1999, 19. The terminology has not been used consistently in research. According to Andrew Hughes, for example, the terms ‘ferial psalter’, ‘liturgical psalter’ and ‘choir psalter’ should be used synonymously; see Hughes 2004, 226. 9 ‘The psalter was one of the most frequently illuminated medieval texts’; Sandler 1999, 19. See Kahsnitz 1979, 141; van der Horst 1996, 55. 10 The materials needed for the Divine Office are discussed in Harper 1991, 75–86, for instance. 11 For a detailed study of a fifteenth-century breviary, see the article by Eva Ferro in this volume. 12 On the development and contents of books of hours, see, for instance, the short overview in Calkins 1983, esp. 243–250.

It is therefore worth considering how potential readers were supposed to navigate through the man-uscripts and access specific texts. Like any other medieval codex, a psalter manuscript is a three-dimensional object. It is therefore necessary to consider not only the arrangement of the content on a page, but how the pages are ar-ranged in the codex. Codicological properties, layout and the pictorial design of the three-dimensional object can be summarised by the term ‘manuscript archi-tecture’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------13\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ A single-text manuscript that was intended to be read continuously from beginning to end may not have needed an elaborate manuscript architec-ture that helped its readers navigate through the manuscript. But a psalter manuscript’s architecture is particularly important to consider with respect to the potential use of these books in the Divine Office, as the 150 psalms were ‘seldom read in a continuous sequence’,\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------14\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ as Michelle Brown rightly points out. Take Psalms 1 to 3 and 6 to 14, for example, which were recited consecutively on Sundays in the secular cursus, while Psalms 4 and 5 were left out.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------15\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ This inter-mittent reading of the psalms, distributed over the eight daily hours on the sev-en days of the week, was rarely reflected in the way they were written down – which was strictly in numerical order. Thus, there would have been a need to access certain psalms directly for the Divine Office. This is precisely where the architecture of psalter manuscripts is important, as it could provide an elabo-rate system to make certain psalms easily accessible. As Lucy Freeman Sandler aptly sums up, ‘[i]n a practical sense decoration served as text articulation, facilitating the finding of the beginning of the text subdivisions’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------16\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ In the follow-ing, different visual characteristics of psalter manuscripts will be discussed that (in theory) enhanced their usability in the Divine Office – regardless of whether the manuscripts were ultimately used or not. \n",
      "level10\t --------------------|| 13 The term ‘manuscript architecture’ was established at the SFB 950 collaborative research centre, ‘Manuscript Cultures in Asia, Africa and Europe’, at the University of Hamburg. See the short discussion in Tumanov 2017, 28 on this expression. 14 Brown 2006, 16. 15 Different numbering systems are used for the psalms. In this study, the numbering follows the Septuagint (and thus also the Vulgate). The numbering systems are discussed in Harper 1991, 67–68. 16 Sandler 1999, 20. \n",

      "level4\t --------2 Dividing the Book of Psalms and structuring the psalter \n",
      "level9\t ------------------Psalter manuscripts display an inner structure, if only because the Book of Psalms is not a coherent text, but rather a collection of individual psalms. Ac-cordingly, the minimum level of structuring the text is the separation of 150 psalms. This is expressed by the use of coloured initials in the manuscripts.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------17\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Additional modes of division which can be found in extant psalter manuscripts group together varying numbers of psalms for purely organisational reasons or according to different usages. One of these modes is a formal division into three equal parts with fifty psalms each.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------18\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ A second mode is found in liturgical psal-ters that are, as Sandler puts it, ‘structured to facilitate the recitation of psalms in Christian worship’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------19\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ In this context, the Book of Psalms was usually divided into eight sections according to the secular cursus. The first seven sections were recited at Matins on each successive day of the week (beginning with Psalms 1, 26, 38, 52, 68, 80 and 97), although individual psalms in these groups were recited at other hours instead. The eighth section, in contrast, comprises all the psalms sung at Vespers in the course of a week (starting with Psalm 109) with-out any further subdivision according to different days of the week. Numerous psalters combine the formal division into three and the liturgical division into eight parts. Since Psalm 1 marks a division in both systems, the manuscripts thus show a ten-part division. In his study on the Werden Psalter (Berlin, Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Preußi-scher Kulturbesitz, Ms. theol. Lat. fol. 358), Rainer Kahsnitz remarks that the ‘liturgical purpose naturally had an influence on the content, the internal struc-ture and the features [or decoration] of psalter manuscripts’.\n",

      "level10\t --------------------|| 17 Sandler notes that verses usually begin with an initial, too. She points out that psalm ini-tials were treated ‘more elaborately than line initials’ from early on (by the seventh century); Sandler 1999, 20. On the matter of psalm initials, see also Hughes 2004, 226–227. 18 On different divisions, see, for instance, Leroquais 1940, xc–xcix; Kahsnitz 1979, 117–141, esp. 117–118; Calkins 1983, 208; van der Horst 1996, 38–39; Hughes 2004, 225. There are also other ways of dividing the Book of Psalms than those discussed in this article. 19 Sandler 1999, 16. 20 Kahsnitz 1979, 115.

      "level9\t ------------------ for example. Despite their individual character, some features recur frequently. They pertain to the internal structure of the manuscripts and should be consid-ered as aids to access specific psalms and navigate through the book as a whole. Rubricated headings, tituli or numbers cannot be considered standard fea-tures in medieval Latin psalter manuscripts. Nonetheless, these manuscripts can display an elaborate decoration system that subdivides the Book of Psalms into smaller sections. With regard to the liturgical eightfold division, Sandler points out that ‘[t]he beginning of each of these sections was articulated visual-ly, generally by enlarged […] initials’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------22\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ This is also true for other systems of dividing the psalms. Initials marking these divisions can be ornamental or his-toriated; some fill entire pages like miniatures. They are, therefore, easy to dis-tinguish from ordinary psalm initials.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------23\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ One example can be found in the Ham-burg Psalter (Hamburg, Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek, Cod. in scrin. 85). The manuscript dates to 1220 and was presumably produced in Thuringia or Saxony.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------24\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The psalms are divided into ten sections, the beginnings of which are highlighted visually by a full-page initial. Page 70 contains the beginning of the second division, which comprises the psalms sung during Matins on Mondays in the non-monastic cursus, namely Psalms 26–37 (Fig. 1). The division begins with a full-page initial of the letter D, the first letter of Psalm 26. It stands out from the rectangular golden background in a green-and-red frame. The first verse is continued on the next page with the rest of the first word, dominus, written in alternating red and blue letters. A distinction is made between the formal three- and the liturgical eightfold division in the ten initials designed in such a prominent manner. Psalms 1, 51 and 101 are not only preced-ed by such an initial on the reverse of the respective leaves, but by a miniature on the corresponding obverse as well. It is not uncommon for psalter manu-scripts to also include miniature cycles in general and miniatures that precede specific sections in addition to the enlarged initials.\n",

Sandler notes that in early times, psalm initials were treated in a similar way to line initials; first changes occur by the seventh century and ‘by the twelfth century they might be the work of different individuals’; Sandler 1999, 20. 23 There are additional possibilities to subdivide the text visually, such as the use of a majuscule script for the first words or images.

On page 29, for instance, Psalm 1 is preceded by the depiction of the Crucifixion. The Crucifixion follows two miniatures showing the Burial of Christ (page 26) and the Ascension (page 28). It has been pointed out in another context that scenes of the Incarnation and Childhood were often grouped together in the miniature cycle preceding the psalms, while the dramatic or triumphant stages of Christ’s salvific work were shown at the main divisions of the Book of Psalms.

      "level12\t ------------------------26\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ In this manuscript, a distinction is made between ordinary psalm initials and those mark-ing the beginning of one of the ten divisions. While ordinary psalm initials general-ly extend over two lines, the first letter of those psalms that mark the beginning of a new division takes up four lines (Fig. 2). Psalm 1 is an exception to this: in the Lut-trell Psalter, as in many other manuscripts, the first initial occupies a special posi-tion.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------27\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ It can be considerably larger and often shows David as the author of the Book of Psalms. Distinguishing between simple psalm initials and those at the beginning of a new division is thus relatively easy in the Luttrell Psalter. Upon closer inspection, however, the manuscript reveals an even more complex disposi-tion: only two of the ten initials do not extend over four lines, namely those found in Psalms 51 and 101, which are only three lines high (Fig. 3). In this respect, it is possible to distinguish between the formal division into three parts and the liturgi-cal eightfold division solely on the basis of the size of the initials. This sort of hier-archy established within the tenfold division appears to have gone unnoticed – or it has not been pointed out explicitly, at least.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------28\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ In this case, the hierarchy of the two modes of division appears to be reversed compared to the Hamburg Psalter, the Luttrell Psalter’s visual organisation elevating the eight-part liturgical division above the formal three-part one. While the division into ten sections is often found in English psalter manuscripts from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, a differentiation or hierarchisation between the initials of the threefold and eightfold division was no longer common at this time.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------29\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The visual organisation with the subtle distinction between formal and liturgical divisions in the Luttrell Psalter is remarkable in this respect. \n",
      "level10\t --------------------|| 26 On the Luttrell Psalter, see Michelle Brown’s substantial commentary in the facsimile, Brown 2006. For a detailed record of the manuscript, see British Library, Digitised Manuscripts, ‘Add MS 42130’. 27 See, for instance, Brown 2006, 31. 28 Brown states that ‘[t]en major (usually 4-line) historiated initials’ are at the beginning of the divisions, but she did not explicitly link the two exceptions to the threefold division; Brown 2006, 31. Hughes argues that the exact size of initials ‘may vary within the same source, and there seems to be no significance to these minor differences’; Hughes 2004, 227. He considers it ‘likely that scribes forgot what sizes and schemes were in use’; Hughes 2004, 227. Varying sizes of initials can, indeed, be observed frequently. In some cases, however, as in the Luttrell Psal-ter, the difference in size appears to be part of a well-thought-out system. 29 Regarding English psalter manuscripts, Günther Haseloff notes that a uniform decoration of the tenfold division predominates towards 1200, while there was a greater emphasis on Psalms 1, 51 and 101 in the first half of the twelfth century; see Haseloff 1938, 9.

Apart from miniatures such as those of the Hamburg Psalter, frames were sometimes incorporated into the manuscripts to highlight specific pages even further. Depending on the degree of decora-tion, these frames can be very distinctive or practically invisible.

Again, the Luttrell Psalter may serve as an example. The degree of decoration varies enormously in this manuscript, with pages that are barely ornamented and others that are lav-ishly decorated. Many of the pages are decorated with partial borders that include floral ornaments in the inner, outer and upper margins (Fig. 5). They are often enriched by small animals, fantastic beasts and human figures. The lower margins were often used for figurative scenes, some of which develop into narratives spanning more than a page. The rich marginal illustrations conceal the structuring function of the frames, which is only revealed upon closer inspection.

At the same time, the visual organisation can also complicate the reader’s use of the co-dex in certain instances such as the transition between different texts. Since litur-gical psalter manuscripts include more than just the Book of Psalms, it is not only the elements that structure the text itself that should be examined, but also those that separate different texts from one another. Typically, the first canticle directly follows the psalms, but without further distinction, it is not always obvious where the Book of Psalms ends and the first canticle begins. The Luttrell Psalter provides another example here, as the Song of Isaiah (Isa. 12:1–6) directly follows after Psalm 150 on fol. 259\n",

In the context of (po-tential) use in the Divine Office, it is important to think about the usefulness of these structuring aids. Initials at the beginning of the divisions make specific sections easily accessible, which is especially true for those cases where ordi-nary psalm initials and division initials are noticeably different. Nevertheless, the liturgical eightfold division does simplify the actual use of the psalms in the Divine Office. Each of the first seven sections contains the psalms sung at Mat-ins on a specific day, but as Andrew Hughes says, ‘some are “removed” for use at other hours. Standard throughout the ages has been the position of Ps. 94, Venite exsultemus, used as the invitatory psalm at the beginning of Matins’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------39\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Taking the example of Psalm 94, this means that in the recitation of psalms at Matins on Fridays, Psalm 93 was followed by Psalm 95, Psalm 94 being used outside the sequence in the psalter as an introduction to prayer. It becomes apparent that the division of the text into eight liturgical groups is only helpful to a certain extent; in general, the psalms that are ‘removed’ for use at other hours are not ‘removed’ from the written text, nor is there a visual indication that the psalms are not to be recited in numerical order. Given the large initials and sometimes the frames, it seems fairly easy to locate the beginning of a spe-cific division. In contrast, individual psalms in the eight groups are not usually given any special markings, which is why it is more difficult to access them directly. Psalm 126, for example, is usually marked by a simple psalm initial, \n",

      "level12\t ------------------------44\n",

      "level9\t ------------------As mentioned before, the Divine Office was not only built on the recitation of psalms, but also included other elements, such as canticles or scriptural lessons. A doxology was repeated after each psalm. The term describes ‘a form of praise to God’, and as John Harper points out, what is known as the lesser doxology, i.e. Gloria patri, was ‘recited at the end of most psalms, can-ticles, and hymns, and near the beginning of most Offices’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------45\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Although the Gloria patri was occasionally inserted towards the end of psalter manu-scripts, it has a more prominent place in some of them. This is the case in three psalter manuscripts held by the British Library, for instance: London, British Library, Arundel MS 305 (second half of the thirteenth century), Bur-ney MS 345 (third quarter of the thirteenth century) and Royal MS 2 B III (first quarter of the thirteenth century).\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------46\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ While they all originate from northern or central France, Ghent or Bruges, other examples show that the inclusion of the Gloria patri is not an exclusive feature of manuscripts produced in this geographic area. Interestingly, the doxology in these three examples has not been included after every single psalm as one might expect with regard to its use during the Divine Office. Rather, its position in the manuscripts seems quite random at first glance. The three manuscripts present the lesser doxol-ogy in a relatively similar way, including it once, or more than once, albeit in varying stages of completeness. Based on the material objects, it can be con-cluded that the lesser doxology was only added where it was ‘convenient’ in terms of the visual organisation, as in London, British Library, Arundel MS 305. Large initials have been drawn at the beginning of the divisions in all three manuscripts. In the case of London, British Library, Arundel MS 305, \n",

      "level9\t ------------------, the text of Psalm 67 leaves three lines of the page blank (Fig. 10). Since those initials that are at the beginning of a division take up six or seven lines, the initial of Psalm 68 could not have been placed in the remaining space on fol. 104\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------r\n",
      "level9\t ------------------. Rather than simply leaving these three lines blank and placing the large initial for Psalm 68 on the next page, as was the case in other manu-scripts,\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ the doxology was used to fill the page. Depending on how much space was left at the bottom of the page, the doxology was either included in its entirety or in parts in abbreviated or un-abbreviated writing. In London, British Library, Arundel MS 305, the decision to fill the blank lines with the Gloria patri appears to have been an aesthetic one: the doxology was not added after every psalm, nor was it put at the end of every section of the psalter. In fact, this only happened in the two cases where the last psalm of one division ended with an unfavourable number of lines left on the page. Although the Gloria patri is part of the Divine Office, the lack of consistency in presenting the formula in the three manuscripts and the fact that it is not a compulsory element of psalter manuscripts indi-cates that there was no practical need to include the doxology in this type of manuscript. Instead, the text seems to have been used to meet the require-ments of the layout.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------While non-monastic clergy or laypeople could find the beginning of the divi-sions recited in the secular cursus by using the visual organisation of their manuscripts, they were confronted with three issues. Firstly, although the majority of the psalms were recited in numerical order, some of them were used at other hours and were not actually repeated as part of their respective sections. However, this is not reflected in the visual organisation of psalter manuscripts. On the contrary, the ‘removed’ psalms have been written down in numerical order along with the others and usually lack any visual hints as to their use at different hours. Secondly, the eighth section comprises all Vespers psalms in both the monastic and non-monastic cursus. Consequent-ly, it is divided into seven groups that correspond to the seven days of the week. Again, this is not usually reflected in the original visual organisation of psalter manuscripts. Thirdly, even though the distribution of psalms dif-fers in the non-monastic and monastic cursus, liturgical psalter manuscripts were generally subdivided according to the non-monastic cursus, even if the manuscript was produced for a monastic user. The first two problems were addressed and resolved to some extent by more recent, post-production additions in the margins, the most frequent being numbering of the psalms. In some cases, later additions also indicate a shift in use. Apart from the problems mentioned above, the reader had to be highly familiar with the manuscript in order to truly recognise and appreciate the intricacies of its visual organisation. Furthermore, it was essential for the reader to have at least some basic knowledge of the ritual practice. While the visual organisation of a psalter manuscript does structure the codex and does offer a potential reader easy access to certain psalms, the purposes for cer-tain features of the visual organisation remain unclear without an under-standing of the related practices. The division into the eight liturgically used groups of psalms, for example, is only understandable to readers if they can link them to the Divine Office and thus understand their origin.  Overall, the visual organisation of a manuscript can have an impact on the reading process, making different psalter manuscripts useful for certain purposes, but not for others. The visual division into liturgical sections makes direct reference to the secular Divine Office, enabling a reader to find the opening psalms of the seven sections to be prayed at Matins throughout the week as well as the group of Vespers psalms. The texts included in addi-\n",

However, it can be difficult to find them quickly, as they were not always highlighted visual-ly. Regardless of the recurring structuring and textual elements in them, which are closely linked to the Divine Office, it is unclear how or to what extent psalter manuscripts were actually used. This is even more the case for psalter manuscripts owned by laypeople. Although it can be assumed that laypeople took part in the celebration of individual hours, especially Matins and Vespers, the exact use of the manuscripts is not documented.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------49\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ It is therefore impossible to say what requirements there actually were on the users’ side regarding manuscript architecture and whether (or how) the manuscripts were incorporated into ritual practices. However, various parts and characteristics of the Divine Office have become physically manifest in the manuscripts (e.g. the eightfold division) and are standard features of the visual organisation of medieval Latin psalter manuscripts.

I would like to thank Hanna Wimmer for allowing me to work on the visual organisation of psalter manuscripts somewhat outside the actual focus of the project.

      "level8\t ----------------Abstract: The anisong manuscripts in this case study specify the rewards gained by people taking part in different funeral procedures and reflect various stages of the physical decay of corpses. The manuscripts were read aloud by monks who held sermons to affirm karmic rewards. Monks and novices were more familiar with Buddhist textual sources than laypeople and played a significant role in the production of anisong manuscripts. Many of the manuscripts in the examined corpus reveal textual revisions and (non-)textual paracontent associ-ated with the interaction of the preaching monks and their sermon audiences. Since the funeral procedures were rituals performed again and again, the man-uscripts were not just circulated but regrouped as necessary, and were also recopied, thereby serving as master versions from which to produce further exemplars. \n",
      "level4\t -------- 1Introduction \n",
      "level8\t ----------------The Thai word anisong is derived from the Pali term ānisaṃsa, which literally means ‘rewards’, ‘benefits’, ‘advantages’ or ‘results of positive deeds’, and rep-resents a textual genre of South-East Asia. Essentially, an anisong is a kind of Buddhist sermon declaring the benefits derived from meritorious acts. These benefits help improve the donor’s karma, but they can also be transferred to other people. Another term referring to anisong sermons or texts is the word salòng or sòng, derived from the Khmer word chlòng. While they are known as salòng sermons, or thet salòng (ເທດສະຫອຼງ), to people in Laos, they are referred to as anisong sermons, or thet anisong (เทศน์อานิสงส)์, in northern Thailand (in what was formerly Lan Na). The titles of anisong texts in Lao manuscripts are mostly preceded by the term salòng or sòng, as in Salòng cedi sai (‘Rewards deriving from building sand stupas’), Sòng fang tham (‘Rewards deriving from listening to the Dhamma’) or Salòng khamphi (‘Rewards deriving from copying religious books’). Sòng or salòng (chlòng ឆ្លង, ສອງ/ສະຫອຼງ), corresponding to chalòng (ฉลอง, ‘to celebrate’) in Thai, is a derivative of the Khmer verb chlòng, which has various meanings: ‘to cross’, ‘to inaugurate’, ‘to dedicate’, ‘to cele-brate’ and ‘to spread’. The contexts of thet salòng or salòng sermons are appar-\n",

As Patrice Ladwig writes, ‘The public act of lauding [oneself] is called saloong in Laos (“to celebrate the outcome of the meritorious deed”) and the donors have variously been described as having prestige or be-ing worthy of veneration’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------1\n",
      "level8\t ---------------- The sermon is held in public, thus it is ‘witnessed’ by all the participants at the funeral. The preaching monk acknowledges the merit and delivers the ser-mons to explain or ‘affirm’ the great rewards generated by the individual’s posi-tive deeds. In Buddhism, such rewards are a result of the person’s generosity. The acquisition of rewards is celebrated afterwards. In exchange for their meri-torious acts, anisong sermons are held to proclaim a person’s benevolent virtue and to promise generous donors commensurate gifts. Terminologically speak-ing, in northern Thailand, anisong signifies ‘the announcement of rewards’, while in Laos, the term salòng or sòng signifies ‘the announcement of comple-tion’. Volker Grabowsky explains it as follows: \n",
      "level10\t --------------------In the Buddhist context Anisong or Salòng [texts] (Lao, from Khmer: chlaṅ (ឆ្លង)), ‘to dedi-cate’, ‘to celebrate’) – often contracted to Sòng – are used for homiletic purposes, such as performing sermons and preaching. Those texts, generally rather short (rarely containing more than twenty folios), describe the rewards in terms of merit, or literally the ‘ad-vantage’ which a believer may expect from a particular religious deed.\n",

He studied the belief of Lao people in transfer-ring things to their late family members at the two festivals. There are slightly different beliefs among the ethnic Lao. Some people believe that items offered to monks can actually reach the dead in the other sphere, whereas others, especially more orthodox Lao people, have a more rational point of view, believing that only dedicational merit can cross the border between the living world and that of the dead.

Mindfulness (Pali: sati-sampajañña) is emphasised in Buddhism as a means to gain self-control, realise what wholesome or unwholesome actions one has caused and confront the notion that death will eventually approach. Thanks to mindfulness, human beings can live their lives carefully, avoid risks that could potentially lead to their untimely death and spend their time on more meaningful things. Before the Buddha’s complete extinction (nirvāna), he left one final maxim concerning mindfulness in relation to the world: ‘Behold, O monks, this is my last advice to you.

The number of monks is more flexible on the occasions of the seventh day, the fiftieth day and the hundredth day of commemorating the deceased, and is decided by the funeral organisers. 10 Justin McDaniel argues that the title Seven Books of the Abhidhamma is misleading, because the text does not contain the entire seven volumes of the Abhidhamma. Rather, it is a commen-tary on it (McDaniel 2008, 233). 11 In Ladwig’s view, ‘Although the Lao and Thai versions of Phra Malai – a text also recited at funerals – are based on the figure of Māleyyadevatthera, they seem to have merged to a certain degree with the figure of Moggallāna due to their similar themes.

Ladwig 2012b, 128. 12 Phra A-thikanratana Ratano 2018, 1. 13 Ladwig writes, ‘The word peta in Pāli usually signifies “hungry ghost”, but its uses in early Theravāda Buddhism are far from clear. The term can denote ancestor (from Sanskrit pitṛ), but also hungry ghost. Further discussions of this will exemplify that this double meaning is also on some level alive in the Lao expression. Historically speaking, the offering to peta is linked to the Brahmanic ritual practice of śrāddha, in which the ghost as a liminal being is transformed into an ancestor’. Ladwig 2012b, 126. 14 According to Daniel M. Veidlinger, ‘In Lan Na, those responsible for the production of man-uscripts were quite conscious of their importance for storing texts. As we will see, many of the manuscripts possess colophons stating explicitly that they were made in order to preserve the teachings of the Buddha for 5,000 years’ (Veidlinger 2007, 6). This is based on the belief in Buddha Metteyya, the fifth Buddha, who will arrive after the current five-thousand-year era, during which the religion will gradually disappear: ‘In the future the religion will decay as people lose their insight into the meaning of the teachings, neglect their practice, and eventu-ally lose the texts themselves. Thus the three divisions will fade from the world in the reverse order that they develop in people of faith, and Buddhism will be no more’. Veidlinger 2007, 59. \n",

After the donations, anisong manuscripts were stored in monastic libraries and used only sporadically. A number of these manuscripts were stored for long periods without being used at all, and consequently many leaves have pale, mirror-image imprints of the ink on adjacent leaves that look like a faint second layer of writing (Fig. 1). This implies that the leaves had been gathered and kept in a tightly bound fascicle for some time after they had been inscribed and dedicated to a monastery; the manuscripts were written in advance and stored for later use on specific occasions.  \n",

A unit consisting of several folios combined in a single binding, with one or two strings through one or two holes in the folios, is called a phuk (‘fascicle’), no matter how many texts it contains. Several fascicles can be combined to make a larger unit – a bundle (mat). A bundle can include one or more fascicles. In terms of this classification scheme, a fascicle is defined as a sub-unit of a bundle. The codicological units of anisong manuscripts are based on these parame-ters and defined as follows. Single-text manuscripts are codicological units that each include a single text, no matter how many fascicles they have. Multiple-text manuscripts are codicological units that include more than one text. It does not matter how many fascicles there are (which obviously depends on the length of the written texts). Composite manuscripts are codicological units that include several fascicles produced at different times by different people and thus constitute a mixture of production units. Each of the fascicles in a compo-site manuscript can thus be a single-text fascicle or a multiple-text one, depend-ing on the scribe’s intention. Accordingly, single-text and multiple-text manu-scripts both contain texts from a single production unit, whereas composite manuscripts are mainly concerned with objects derived from different produc-tion units. Sometimes anisong and non-anisong fascicles are grouped into one and the same bundle. The fascicles may be from different production units despite being combined in the same bundle.

Once bound, a codex is relative-ly stable and does not allow for easy modification.

The texts were written one after the other with a small symbol between the previous text and the next one.

Acts of merit are basically done for different purposes at different times.

      "level8\t ----------------Funerals are important because they are life-transition rituals. The manuscripts discussed here were required for funerary rituals and were therefore in high demand, but limited in number and kept at monasteries. Accordingly, in the past, anisong manuscripts used for funerals were often borrowed and circulated in the community. Ownership notes found in several anisong manuscripts re-flect this, their aim being to ensure that the manuscript was returned to its proper place. The manuscript entitled Sòng sak sop khon tai (BAP, BAD-13-1-0771) was sponsored by a group of laypeople and inscribed by a monk associat-ed with Vat Siang Thòng, but it is currently kept at Vat Saen Sukharam. The manuscript must have been circulated among local monasteries in Luang Pra-bang until it ended up being stored in its current monastic repository. An own-ership note added to the last folio – simply the name ‘Vat Saen’ – evidently relates to this culture of manuscript circulation. Admonitions about returning manuscripts to their rightful places (monasteries) are sometimes found along with affiliation markers. A palm-leaf manuscript kept in Lampang province includes an admonition and the following ownership statement: ผู้ต้องการยืมเอาไปทางใด ขอเอามาไวว้ดับ้านเอ้ือมดัง่เก่า สัมมาที่ใด สัมไปที่นั้น อย่าไปลมืเน้อ Borrowers should return the manuscript to Wat Ban Üam; please return things to their rightful location.

      "level13\t --------------------------74\n",
      "level10\t -------------------- || 71 Unlike paper manuscripts, palm-leaf manuscripts are mostly numbered using a combina-tion of consonant and vowel graphemes, according to the order used for the arrangement of words written in Devanagari and other Indic scripts (for the sake of simplicity, I will call it just ‘Sanskrit orthography’ here). This system of foliation is especially used for manuscripts that contain religious texts. The first twelve folios would start with a k (a voiceless and unaspirated velar), the first consonant of the alphabet, which is then combined with twelve vowels – a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, e, ai, o, au, aṃ, aḥ – used in Sanskrit. Apart from the last one, these vowels are pro-nounced in a similar way to the corresponding vowels in Lao. The first twelve folios would be paginated, for example, as follows: ka, kā, ki, kī, ku, kū and so on, which corresponds to one, two, three, four, five, six etc. (up to twelve). In the case of a longer text, i.e. a fascicle of a palm-leaf manuscript comprising more than twelve leaves, the remaining consonants, such as kh, g, gh, ṅ, c, ch, j, jh, ñ and so forth, would likewise be combined with the same set of twelve vow-els. Khamvone and Grabowsky 2017, 20–21. 72 Manuscripts were shared by local temples and circulated among them. They were some-times kept at a specific monastery and borrowed by monks from other temples. 73 Numerous palm-leaf manuscripts found in the abode of the Venerable Monk Sathu Nyai Khamchan Virachitto are also foliated using two systems, numerals and words. As Khamvone Boulyaphonh and Volker Grabowsky have observed, ‘The numeral was mostly written in the left-hand margin of the first page of each leaf, whereas the numerated word was placed in the traditional manner. Some palm-leaf manuscripts have been foliated twice, first with the com-bination of consonant and vowel graphemes as described above and a second time (mostly not by the original scribe but by a later user) by using numerals’.

      "level8\t ----------------Funerals are held to commemorate the dead and remind the attendees to be aware of the transience of life. Besides describing the rewards one could gain from taking part in different funeral processes, anisong manuscripts delineate the various stages of physical decay that corpses undergo. Anisong sermons are given by monks to promise forthcoming rewards to the participants themselves and to the dead. Funerals are organised in the form of social activities and can be attended by family members, relatives and friends of the deceased as well as other people, all of whom receive rewards. The sangha community was familiar with Buddhist textual sources, including the frequently mentioned Amata-sutta, and was therefore particularly responsible for producing anisong manuscripts. Since holding sermons was a practice that was not restricted to well-trained preachers, mistakes and revisions are commonly found in the manuscripts in our corpus, but they never devalue the sacredness of the manuscripts, as they were corrected by the preaching monks and the texts were always read aloud. Anisong manuscripts provide evidence of interaction between monks and their lay audience during sermons, in which the monks were expected to wear suita-ble attire and talk to the attendees to alleviate their grief as need be. Since fu-nerals have remained a living tradition, the manuscripts were sometimes re-grouped to create new bundles used for subsequent funerals. In some cases, the bundles could be undone and individual sections could be taken out and rein-serted later. Funerals were such regular occurrences that anisong manuscripts were also used as master versions to make further copies. Mulberry-paper man-uscripts were produced in a pothi shape to imitate palm leaves when this natu-ral material started to become rare.\n",

During his reign, books were used as a space for political reflection, creative and scientific experimentation, as a place in which to gather previous traditions that could serve as a theoretical frame-work for new postulates, and as a platform for projection into the future. As a result, book culture became the cornerstone of his governmental action and, as we shall see, the book became a distinctive element of his visual representation. Alfonso X rose to the throne in 1252 and, from the very beginning of his reign, he took advantage of the rich cultural scene of the Iberian Peninsula. Al-Andalus had become an important hub of exchange connecting influences from the Islamic sphere, and a fertile area for cultural and scientific creation. Classi-cal sources translated into Arabic circulated alongside newly created works, which meant that several cities, most notably Toledo, became points of refer-ence for scholars from other parts of Europe who came to translate Arabic man-uscripts into Latin.\n",

The use of knowledge was an outstanding feature of the royal figure, to the extent that the monarch had the obligation to form himself and study the different kinds of sciences in order to make proper use of them. The dictum ‘rex illiteratus est quasi asinus coronatus’ (‘an ignorant king is like a crowned donkey’), a message that John of Salisbury codified in his Policraticus (c. 1159), one of the most important texts of medieval political theory, is widely known. In this work, the author points out the risk of leaving the kingdom in the hands of an ignorant ruler because ‘without wisdom no government is able to endure or exist’.\n",

      "level12\t ------------------------12\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The king assumed wisdom as the essential leitmotiv of his governmental action, and the construction of his figure and definition of his political project were indissolubly blended with this concept. In the Libro del fuero de las leyes, known as the Siete Partidas, the seven-parts law code com-missioned by the king, we can find a clear reflection of this. In the ‘II Partida’, or ‘Second Part’, the chapter devoted to the royal figure and his duties, the text asserts: \n",

And, even without this, by means of the Scriptures he will the better understand the Faith, and will know more perfectly how to pray to God. By reading, he can become acquainted with the remarkable events that transpire, from which he will learn many good habits and examples. Not only did the wise men of the ancients deem it proper that a king should know how to read, but also that he should study all the sciences in order to be able to profit by them. On this subject King David, while giving advice to kings, said, that they should be learned and wise, since they had to judge the earth. King Solomon, his son, also said that kings should learn the sciences and should not forget them, for by means of them they would have to judge and protect their people.\n",

Y aun sin todo esto, por la escritura entenderá mejor la fe, y sabrá más cumplidamente rogar a Dios, y aun por el leer puede él mismo saber los hechos granados que pasaron, de lo que aprenderá muchos buenos ejemplos. Y no tan solamente tuvieron por bien los sabios antiguos que los reyes supiesen leer, más aún, que aprendiesen de todos los saberes para poderse aprovechar de ellos, y en esta razón dijo el rey David aconsejando a los reyes que fuesen entendidos y sabios, pues que ellos han de juzgar la tierra y eso mismo dijo el rey Salomón a su hijo; “que los reyes aprendiesen los saberes y no los olvidasen, pues por ellos habían de juzgar y mantener a las gentes”’, Alfonso X, Las Siete Partidas, ed. Boletín Oficial del Estado 2011, vol. 2, Title 5, Law 16. 14 The Sirr al-asrâr was translated into Latin on two occasions as Secretum secretorum; the first, as a sort of abridged version of the work, by Johannes Hispalensis in the twelfth century, and the second, from the complete text, by Philippus Tripolitanus around 1220. An abridged version of the Arabic text was translated into Castilian in the mid-thirteenth century under the name Poridat de Poridades, and the complete Latin text was also translated into Castilian during the reign of Alfonso X as Secreto de los secretos.

There is no globe, there is no sceptre, the common symbols of the royalty, the object that represents the es-sence of the king is a book. Through these compositions the king makes himself present and assumes different roles in the creative process: author, co-ordinator, patron and reader. His presence distinguishes the manuscripts as a royal product. But these images also play a fundamental role, projecting the monarch as a sapiential figure and commemorating him in his historical dimension so that he might be remem-bered by future generations, ‘los que auíen de uenir’ (‘the ones who had to come’); a goal, almost an obsession, that underlies the entire Alfonsine produc-tion.

      "level9\t ------------------ As we can see, the court of Alfonso X became a ‘theatre of knowledge’ where the king played the main role, often depicted with written culture as a distinctive element, reading, commenting or holding a book in his hands. Moreover, the court, both the real and the one constructed through the images shown in the illuminated manuscripts, was full of books; books for praying, books for playing, books for studying and books for wielding power in government. However, there are still many unknowns about the use of books in the court, their location and who had access to them. We must think that depending on the content and the target audience, the circumstances of access and use of the books would be different. In this sense, a double category must be estab-lished, since, on the one hand, there were books used as a source of knowledge, and, therefore, with an evident component of study and reference, and books conceived as representational manuscripts, in which their functional character was combined with a strong symbolic charge (e.g. memorial, political, socially prestigious, religious).

In parallel with this sapiential vision, some sources devel-oped a less friendly and positive vision of the king, in which he was portrayed as a proud and arrogant person who had sacrificed his kingdom for the sake of scientific knowledge, specifi-cally astronomy and astrology. As Leonardo Funes pointed out years ago, this negative view probably emerged in Sancho IV’s entourage as a strategy to justify Sancho’s uprising against his father and his controversial accession to the throne (Funes 2016).

The visual narrative unfolds over six vignettes in which the illuminators, with their characteristic documentary interest, were able to represent the drama of the situation and the joy of the king’s recovery thanks to the action of the Virgin represented by the book (see Fig. 1). In the fifth vignette, Alfonso, seated on the bed, raises the codex and kisses it devoutly while those present look at the king in wonder. In the last image, after the miracle, Alfonso and his courtiers thank the Virgin Mary, while the book, already closed, rests on the king’s lap. To invoke Our Lady’s saving action, the book must be opened; it is not enough to place it on the monarch’s sick body; its manipulation is required, in what we could understand as a metaphor of the need for its use, not only for its possession.

The Cantigas de Santa Maria (hereafter CSM) was one of the most ambi-tious and personal projects undertaken by the king. It is not only a devotion-al work but also an account of his time, his kingdom and his person, a tool to show his intellect as an author and his privileged position as a king protected by the Virgin Mary. The work began possibly in the 1260s, although it is wide-ly known that it grew and evolved throughout the entire rule of Alfonso X.  \n",

Traditionally, it has been consid-ered that the king himself wrote part of the repertoire, but there are still many gaps in this respect regarding the other composers. Walter Mettmann proposed the participation of Airas Nunes as one of the main authors, a question that has recently been extended by José Antonio Souto, who, together with other scholars such as Elvira Fidalgo Francisco or Henrique Mon-teagudo, has pointed to the participation of a group of clerics in the elaboration of the CSM. It has also been suggested that the Franciscan Juan Gil de Zamora may have contributed in some way to the process.

Although this is one of the main testimonies of the CSM, there are doubts about where and when this manuscript was made, in fact, it could be a later copy dated to the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century. An overview of the historiographical problem is in Fernández Fer-nández 2008–2009. 32 Except for the first cantiga, which has an illuminated folio with eight vignettes in accord-ance with the eight joys of the Virgin, the rest of the cantigas have six, save for those ending in the number five, which have a double illuminated folio, so, the story is represented in twelve vignettes. 33 Actually, the Códice de Florencia includes two cantigas that were not copied in the Códice de los músicos, F14 (CSM 408) and F86 (CSM 409).

On the other side of the composition, a cleric checks the musical notation in a roll, and together with him, a group of musicians tune their instruments.

      "level13\t --------------------------r\n",
      "level10\t --------------------, seems to confirm this. We do not know whether there were other manuscripts whose traces have been lost, or whether the quires were used when the manu-script was not completely finished, which would broaden the functional significance of these materials. But regardless of the late production of Códice Rico, Códice de Florencia and Códice de los músicos, the CSM as a poetic and musical product must have been present in the courtly environment, and probably in the sanctuaries referred to in the songbook. However, as Kirstin Kennedy pointed out, the fact that the monarch did not provide resources to the places where the CSM should have been performed did not favour their incorporation into ceremonial con-texts (Kennedy 2004, 211), beyond a possible interpretation of the cantigas dedicated to the feasts of Mary in the royal chapel in Seville (Ferreira 2016, 315–316). For this reason, after the death of the monarch, and as the use of Galician-Portuguese became less present at court, the tradition of the CSM gradually died out, until it disappeared from the collective imagination, remaining only as a scholarly product accessible to certain personalities (Fernández Fernández 2021b). However, Dionisio Preciado discovered the trace of the melody of one of the cantigas in a piece of sixteenth century Spanish music preserved in the Cancionero Musical de Palacio (‘Palace musical songbook’), which could be an indication of its survival in the music of the court (Preciado 1987). \n",

The king, once again, is sitting in the centre of the composition, with an open book, ap-parently addressing a few words to the singers who look at him, ready to begin; one of them is also holding an open book and a scribe dressed in an elegant manner is listening attentively with the calamus (pen), the inkwell and a roll in his hands, as if he were going to take note of what happened. On both sides of the composition, the musicians with their instruments are also waiting, but some members of the court, distinguished by their clothing, are depicted near the monarch, therefore, the image no longer represents the work in progress, but rather a public performance of one of the songs. The picture gathers and codifies the long musical and poetic tradition of the court of the Learned King and preserves it to be transmitted to those who would have access to the manu-script for centuries to come. In addition to the use that the books of the CSM may have had in the final years of the reign, it is important to think about the use that Alfonso X wanted to give to his books after his death, the mission that he entrusted to them. Ac-cording to Alfonso’s will, his books of songs should be preserved and performed on Marian and Our Lord feast days in the place where he was buried, therefore, to be used in a para-liturgical context: \n",

Documentary evidence sug-gests that of the CSM manuscripts, only the Códice de los músicos was kept in the cathedral for a long period. In fact, everything seems to indicate that this manuscript was conceived as a general archive for the project, and that it was already planned to be deposited in the royal chapel to be used for the festivities of the Virgin, as the king’s will specified. Years later, the manuscript was claimed by Philip II (1527–1598) to be incorporated into the library that the monarch was creating in the monastery of El Escorial. However, the Códice Rico and the Códice de Florencia remained in the possession of the royal house, first in Seville and later in the alcázar of Segovia, one of the residences where the royal treasure, including the library, was kept, as we know from the inventories carried out in Segovia in 1503 and 1505, as well as from other documentary ref-erences. In 1576, the Códice Rico also became part of the Escorial library, donat-ed by Philip II, however, the Códice de Florencia had been gifted by Queen Isa-bel ‘la Católica’ (1451–1504) to Andrés Cabrera, marquis of Moya, in 1475 in gratitude for his services and support, and after a long journey through various private libraries it came into the possession of the Medici family in Florence.\n",

The monarch, seated in a prominent chair adorned with his heraldry, appears in the absolute centre of the image. He is flanked by several figures, to our left, despite their deterioration we can identify ecclesiastical dignitaries, and on the right side, we find another differentiated group, members of the royal family, dressed in maximum wealth. The king carries a raised sword in his right hand, symbol of his governing capacity and the administration of justice, and he carries a richly bound book in his left, that he delivers to the Infante seated next to him, his heir (see Fig. 5). At the bottom, other members of the nobility attend as wit-nesses who validate the action. In my opinion, the image commemorates the official nomination of Sancho IV (1258–1295) as heir to the kingdom in the pres-ence of the court and his new role as ruler alongside his father from 1278.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------42\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ It is very eloquent that the transfer of power to the heir is expressed with the deliv-ery of a book from the king to his son. The book here becomes a symbol of the royal power, a power that is sustained by the continuation of the lineage, which is, in turn, reflected in the book in which the action is represented. It is im-portant to note that the folio depicting the action was added to the body of the manuscript years after the book had been started.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ In fact, the copying and the illumination of this manuscript had been interrupted at a certain point (c. 1274), probably because another version of the text was being prepared, but the rele-vance of the work, the Estoria de España, therefore, the history of the Iberian Peninsula, with deep political roots, gave the codex a symbolic value beyond the accuracy of its content. The inclusion of this image reinforced its function as a thesaurus, as a representational book. \n",

If we accept that the scene represents the appointment of Sancho as heir and coregent, the image must have been made after 1278, but before 1282, when Sancho and his father broke off their relationship.

      "level9\t ------------------ Once again it is important to consider two categories of books, those used as working material and, therefore, intended for practical use, and those also conceived as representational books and part of the royal treasure.

      "level9\t ------------------The sixteen treatises that make up the book are grouped into three main themat-ic blocks: the analysis of constellations, the scientific instruments used for the study of the stars and the application of these tools, and different systems of time measurement. According to the prologues, the first translations began in the mid-1250s and were revised and expanded over the following years, as well as new works being created. As in the case of the CSM or works with historical or legal content, the production of manuscripts of this type involved the writing of previous drafts, which were used both in the development of the content and in the process of copying and final revision. Unfortunately, the drafts that played a decisive role in the production of these works have not survived, or have not been identified, but thanks to the study of the texts and the composi-tion of the manuscripts, as well as the workshop marks or corrections and anno-tations visible on many folios, we can approximate the working system. In the case of the Libro del saber de astrología, the manuscript in which the sixteen treatises and the general prologue to the work were copied and illustrated was completed in the city of Burgos in 1278. This is an important point because, if we cross-reference this information with that provided by the royal diplomas, we can see that the court was located in the city of Burgos at that time, so the mate-rials and agents involved in the making of the manuscript travelled with the court and the king could have been in contact with the production process.\n",

Thanks to these two testimonies, we can affirm that during the reign of Alfonso XI (1331–1350), a rich merchant from Florence, who probably played a relevant role in the economic and diplomatic relationships with the court, and some people related to scientific circles in Paris, had access to the Libro del saber de as-trología preserved in the royal library. In both cases, the book must have aroused great interest in them, as they commissioned or made copies of it. As these references show, the walls of the palace were a permeable frontier that allowed people from different origins and backgrounds to obtain direct information of what was happening inside and, therefore, to spread and use it for obvious propagandistic or practical purposes. The court was organized and defined as a space of cultural exchange where actors of very different sorts par-ticipated. In this courtly scenography, science reached a relevant role as some-thing intellectually and socially distinctive, therefore, the interest in copying and possessing manuscripts with scientific content by scholars and members of high social and economic levels should not surprise us. As we have seen, and recovering our main theme of analysis, the book ac-quired a prominent role in the Alfonsine court. It was used not only as a work-ing tool but also as a piece of representation, becoming a symbol of royal power, capable of distinguishing the political action developed by Alfonso X, a king who decided to turn wisdom into the basis of his government, and in doing so, transformed his court into a ‘theatre of knowledge’, being known for genera-tions to come as the Learned King.

      "level9\t ------------------Abstract: The present contribution offers an insight into the formation and de-velopment of multiple-text manuscripts (MTMs) transmitting works earmarked for liturgical and healing performances connected with the veneration of saints in Ethiopia. The time span covered ranges between the fourteenth century and the present time. Themes related to the role of manuscripts in the making of Ethiopian sainthood and keeping it alive will be explored. The main points dis-cussed are (1) the acquisition and structuring of a corpus of hagiographic texts in MTMs; (2) the perception of these MTMs in connection with the construction of Ethiopian sainthood; (3) their function in the authentication to sainthood in Ethiopia; and (4) their use in liturgical and healing performances. \n",
      "level4\t --------1 Vox populi, vox Dei \n",
      "level9\t ------------------The construction of the fama sanctitatis of holy people in Ethiopia, as in the rest of the Christian world, generally arises among the members of the community who were in touch with them during their lifetime or in places connected in some way with their fame. These locations progressively became pilgrimage destinations, sites of churches, and shelters for sufferers and indigents who invoked their intercession and made known the effects of it (healings, protec-tion, comfort). The fama sanctitatis spread from these places, often with the patronage of the local ecclesiastical communities which encouraged, legitimis-ing it, a cult already established in popular practice by the faithful. The verification of sainthood in late antique and medieval Ethiopia did not entail any official initiative from the high religious authorities in a modern sense, although a sort of ratification probably occurred when the hagiographic narrative of saints was written down and copied in manuscripts which started to circulate and be read on their memorial day. This stage possibly marks the for-mal, official establishment of the devotion towards saints, since the manuscript is the essential medium which makes possible their liturgical commemoration \n",

The ceremony’s officiant, after reading a portion or the whole Life of the saint aloud to the audience, blows in a basin or a bottle containing water. The action of blowing into the water, as I was told, aims at transmitting the spirit (manfas), acquired by the officiant through the reading of the manuscript, to the water which then becomes holy and curative. This water is subsequently used for performing healing rituals, such as exorcisms and ablutions of patients’ bodies (also of animals), and is also sprinkled on cultivated fields infested by parasites (see Subsection 8.2). During the ceremony of the saint’s tazkār, the same water is also sprinkled over the ceremony’s at-tendants to bless and protect them from any sort of illness and demons’ attack.

I could also observe that the action of blowing is not al-ways performed, especially during the celebrations of the annual commemora-tion of the saints, probably because of the high number of people attending the ceremonies. On these occasions, the faithful, shortly before the reading of the manuscript, place open bottles or jars full of water (Fig. 1) near to the lectern which holds the manuscript during the reading and collect them once the read-ing is accomplished. In these cases, the action of reading the manuscript aloud is sufficient to transmit the manfas to the water and for this reason, both bottles and jars are left open during the reading.  \n",

Obviously, the study of manuscripts and related prac-tices is contextualized and analysed from a synchronic perspective, but this does not mean that such a paradigm might not have a diachronic relevance. In the example shown above, the two witnesses transmitting the sentence ‘If one was exorcised, was washed or drank the holy water (deriving by the reciting) of this manuscript’ are dated to the twentieth century and, indeed, they attest a contemporary practice. On the other hand, observing the contemporary use of manuscripts reveals some facets which cannot be detected from their material evidence. The reason is that these facets pertain to a sphere of immaterial knowledge which follows a different channel of transmission – oral or experien-tial transmission – that usually does not leave any material trace in the manu-scripts. The results provided by both material and immaterial evidence not only complement each other, as long as the diachronic perspective is observed, but also inform us about evolutions and possible changes over time. There is no question that each piece of evidence mirrors the historical context to which it is referred, but it is also true that contemporary practices can be projected back into the past – if they are supported by material evidence – and ancient practic-es can be considered still alive – if they are materially detectable in manu-scripts. \n",

The reason probably lies in the commemorative practices spread in the late antique and early medie-val period in Ethiopia and particularly in the fact that only the veneration of a certain number of saints was diffused at that time.

      "level9\t ------------------The considerations made about the transmission of the hagiographic corpus in Gǝʿǝz suggests that its organisation in the MTMs had a complex history, the process of which can be at present only partly understood.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------55\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The structure of the collections, as it is known today in the manuscripts, must be regarded as the result of a long process of revision, adaptation and reshaping of both texts and manuscripts. The most ancient MTMs so far known are dated to the thirteenth to fourteenth century and can be chronologically set in an intermediate period between the disappearing of the late antique Aksumite heritage based on Greek knowledge transmission and the absorption of the medieval Christian Arabic culture. The growing number of texts translated from Arabic, from the four-teenth century onwards, must have required a reshaping of the corpus in the MTMs and the revision of the individual texts both from a linguistic and materi-al point of view. The new texts translated from Arabic were combined with more ancient texts translated from Greek, some of which might also have possibly gone through a retranslation process from Arabic or through a revision based on one (or more) Arabic model.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------56\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ This process, aiming at producing manuscripts readapted each time to liturgical needs, was not only associated with a physical rearrangement of the texts in the MTMs, but also with a progressive change in the size of the MTMs. The evidence collected show that the increasing number of saints to be celebrated fostered an enlargement of the corpus, leading to the production of manuscripts of considerable size (in some cases, two volumes), large enough to accommodate more hagiographies. The Acts of the martyrs and (although less) the Acts of the saints’ collections were very popular in the Ethio-pian monasteries between the fourteenth and the sixteenth century: a growing number of MTMs were copied, disseminated and used for the liturgical com-memoration of the saints. The chronological attestation of the MTMs allows one to determine the importance of these collections attested in a few MTMs even before the diffusion of the first recension of the Ethiopic Synaxarion at the end of the fourteenth century. The peak of both Acts of the martyrs and Acts of the saints’ MTMs circulation is attested between the fourteenth and fifteenth centu-\n",
      "level10\t --------------------|| 55 Apart from a few exceptions (Bausi 2002; Bausi 2017; Bausi and Gori 2006), the lack of proper critical editions of the texts of the corpus makes it difficult currently to propose more accurate conclusions, mostly concerning the thorny matter of the Vorlage of the individual texts, for which some reflections were proposed by Bausi 2002, 15–18. 56 A process well-known in works translated in the Gǝʿǝz language, cf. Bausi 2018. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------ry. However, the diachronic distribution of the surviving manuscripts reveals an undeniable countertrend looming on the horizon from the second half of the sixteenth century and symptomatic of a cultural change in veneration practices in progress. In this period, the circulation of MTMs transmitting the second recension of the Ethiopic Synaxarion increased and kept on growing in the fol-lowing centuries, while the circulation of the Acts of the martyrs and Acts of the saints’ MTMs progressively began to decrease. It can be presumed that the spread of the second recension of the Ethiopic Synaxarion must have offered a new model of MTMs that the old MTM type could not emulate, determining its progressive dismissal.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------57\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ From a material point of view, indeed, the MTMs trans-mitting the Synaxarion are organised in a less rigid structure, compared with the Acts of the martyrs and Acts of the saints’ MTMs, and, consequently, their ar-rangement satisfied the new ritual requirements in a more effective way: (1) the hagiographies are shorter; (2) they cover the whole liturgical year; and (3) more than one saint is commemorated each day. The short readings, in substance, allowed one to accommodate the commemorative readings of more saints for the whole liturgical year in solely two volumes. The reason behind the success of the new MTMs’ form lies in a change in the liturgical practices: the veneration of more saints implied a multiplication of hagiographic texts to be read (almost) every day of the liturgical year. This does not mean that this sort of conflict between the two MTM types entailed the replacement of the former to the ad-vantage of the new type, since the two collections have a different function, being read at two different moments of the liturgical office.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------58\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ It only means that the new MTM type could not serve as a model for reshuffling the old MTM type. The inclusion of more and more texts and additional commemoration dates would have led to the production of giant MTMs – even bigger than they were already – impossible to handle. From the second half of the sixteenth century, the old MTM type was set aside, although not yet completely dismissed, and additional MTM forms started to emerge. This process coincides with the in-creasing production of texts on local saints. \n",
      "level10\t --------------------|| 57 This hypothesis, already proposed by Bausi 2002, 12–14, is corroborated by the new docu-mentation acquired in the last few years, which allowed the number of MTMs known at the time to double. 58 The Synaxarion is performed every day during the office of the morning while the Acts of the martyrs and the Acts of the saints are a main reading on the memorial day of the individual saints. \n",

The individual textual units are shaped in the form of commemorative readings of various lengths laid out in calendrical order to be performed on the saints’ memorial days. The visual organisation of the MTMs’ pages enables the reader to easily identify each textual unit and sub-unit. The decorations of the frontispiece and the beginning of the textual units range between plain geometric ornaments and more elaborated pictorial motifs. They can consist of rubricated words; straight lines made of dots or/and strokes in alternate black and red ink; pictorial frames filled with geometric patterns surrounding the text area (and the columns) and sometimes dividing the page into two registers (upper and lower); and traditional ḥarags or ribbon-shaped horizontal bands (sometimes enriched with perpendicular bands framing the text from the side and dividing the columns) filled with interlaced geometric or organic motifs and provided at the top with stylized leaves. The frontispiece can occasionally also be decorated with illuminations portraying the saints or Bibli-cal figures. Linear graphic lines are normally used to (1) mark the end of the previous textual unit (Fig. 3); (2) delineate the caesura between two textual units (Fig. 4); or (3) distinguish the sub-units (e.g. miracles, blessing formulae, final titles, subscriptions, colophons) of the textual units (Figs 3 and 4). The most lavish MTMs use pictorial frames, ḥarag and sometimes minia-tures to flag the beginning of a textual unit, although their use within the same MTM is often inconsistent (Fig. 5). They can differ in style and size, be placed over one (Fig. 4), two (Figs 2 and 6) or three columns, or frame the text area and/or the intercolumn. The title and incipit of the textual units are commonly written in red and black ink in alternate lines or group of lines and sometimes also in balanced columns, distributed in the upper or lower register of the text area, where the vertical space is precisely calculated to obtain columns of the same length (Fig. 6). The balanced columns can also shape the end of a textual unit. \n",

In fact, one cannot deny that the image of the ‘garments descending into Paradise’ is quite bizarre. The main problem in this sentence is to identify the subject of the verb warada, a third person mascu-line singular form. On the one hand (Life of Ṗanṭalewon), we have the relative pronoun za- that agrees in both gender and number with the verb warada and, thus, works perfectly as the subject of the verb. On the other hand (antiphons), we have the broken plural form of an inanimate noun, ʾalbās-i-hu, that can take a singular verb agreement. In this regard, I would say that both interpretations appear to be correct. A second problem lies in the awkward expression za-warada wǝsta gannat (‘that descended into Paradise’) for which we would ex-pect a different verb, such as ዐርገ ʿarga (‘ascended’) as – just to oversimplify – \n",

On the contrary, the longer text of the Life of Ṗanṭalewon offers more details that may guide us to recognise the original intent and meaning of the episode narrated.

I decided to translate it here with the English term ‘rafts’ instead of ‘ships’, firstly, to differentiate it from the term አሕማር ʾaḥmār ‘ships’ (broken plural of ሐመር) also present in the text of the Life of Kāleb and, secondly, considering the development of the textual plot. La Spisa also translates it with scialuppe (‘rafts’), cf. La Spisa 2021, 171, n. 254. 120 The text in this point is unclear. The codex unicus of the Gadla Kāleb displays the reading ስልሔ sǝlḥe preceded by an erased letter difficult to reconstruct. The term sǝlḥe is not attested in the Gǝʿǝz lexica, neither is the root ሰለሐ salaḥa (or ሰልሐ). Considering the context in which the term occurs in the text, some very preliminary, even though not decisive, observations can be made. The closest semantically (but not morphologically) related term is recorded in Wolf Leslau: ሰላሂ salāhi (‘horsefly’), cf. Leslau 1991, 499. One could then guess that the term derives from the same root as salāhi with a possible meaning of ‘horse tail’. An alternative hypothesis could be that the root is ሰሐለ saḥala (‘to sharpen’) instead, and that the word sǝlḥe underwent metathesis of the second and third radical. The root is well attested in Gǝʿǝz (cf. Dillmann 1865, 327; Leslau 1991, 493) as well as in other semitic languages, cf. Leslau 1991, 493 (see particular-ly the metathesis occurring in Hebrew: šęlaḥ ‘javelin’).

It is considered a holy artefact and is kept in the sancta sanctorum (maqdas) of the church, where only the regular clergy are allowed to enter. The tābots can be dedicated to saints, angels, God, Mary, Jesus Christ, the Trinity or the Holy Spirit. They can be engraved with decorations, crosses, figures and short inscriptions, usually the name of the dedicatee, cf. Heldman 2010, with additional bibliographical references. Churches can possess more than one tābot, but the name of the church always derives from the main tābot in use, which is considered the embodiment of the person to whom is dedicated and ensures her/his presence during the liturgical celebrations. In an important contribution de-voted to the Ethiopian altars, Emmanuel Fritsch explains the presence of more than one tābot in Ethiopian churches in the light of veneration practices. Evidence on the ‘multiplication of tābotāt’ in Ethiopian churches of the Lāstā region is attested already in the thirteenth century, \n",

In any case, no centralised institution responsible for the authentication of sainthood was present in Ethiopia at that time.

According to the scholar, this phenomenon in Ethiopia ‘was a sequel to a movement in the Coptic Church whereby people wanted to respond to their felt need to dedicate churches to more saints. Una-ble to build new churches because of adverse circumstances, they erected new altars dedicated to these saints’, cf. Fritsch 2012, 454 and passim. It is interesting to note that the ‘multiplication of tābotāt’ in Ethiopian churches has a parallel in the ‘multiplication of hagiographic texts’ occurring in the same period, as we have seen, which reveals that they are the consequence of a ‘multiplication of saints’ to be venerated and, at the same time, the evidence of a cultural and religious change in progress. 126 Brita 2008, 293 (text) and 327 (translation), § 1. 127 Bausi 2003, vol. 1, 24 (text) and vol. 2, 28, § 2. 128 According to manuscript Collegeville, MN, Hill Museum and Manuscript Library, EMML 1763.

The production, dissemination and liturgical use of hagio-graphic MTMs must, therefore, have contributed to the official recognition of the local saints, spread their fame and fostered their commemoration beyond the local communities, where their cult was initially promoted. The sacral value assigned to hagiographic manuscripts and their central role in the liturgical commemoration of saints must have acted as an agent in perceiving them as institutional objects capable of testifying the sainthood of the figures described therein. A sort of official device for the official recognition of saints. Texts were apparently included in (and excluded from) these MTMs as soon as the commemoration of their protagonists was introduced (or ceased) in the country. This process explains the progressive translation of texts and the continuous reshaping and revision of the collections. The inclusion of hagi-ographies on Ethiopian saints of foreign origins reveals, on the one hand, the progressive emergence of the local hagiography and, on the other hand, the effort to make the veneration of the local saints official. Furthermore, the ad-vantage of the editorial innovation introduced by the Synaxarion made it possi-ble to increase the number of hagiographies about local saints and, consequent-ly, their commemoration. The MTMs were widespread in the main monasteries and churches (as is witnessed by the number of copies still extant), so that the names of those saints had the possibility to circulate widely throughout the country and be fixed in the collective memory through the ritual reading. Hence, these MTMs will not be considered as a heterogeneous combination of individual texts but rather as a coherent result of a project planned and real-ised on the basis of specific material and religious demands and readapted each time to specific liturgical needs and veneration practices. \n",

This contributed to shape habits and behaviours in daily life, propagate an ethics of respect, altruism, obedience and sacrifice, and submissively accept adverse and unpleasant experiences as God’s will.

In fact, the current perception of these works is culturally too distant for conceiving their meaning and scope in the late antique and medieval period. In order to be properly understood, the reception of this literary genre should be contextualized and brought back to the mentality of that time. Hagi-ographies were addressed to a simple public, not used to the abstract theological debates dominating Christian thought (especially in the Oriental churches). The stylistic choice of an intelligible language and straightforward metaphors was addressed to a public (mostly unedu-cated) who had difficulty abandoning old beliefs and needed to be persuaded with concrete examples, drawn from a familiar everyday life in which, through a sentiment of identification, they could feel indirectly protagonists. \n",

As such, the liturgy is conservative: the language incorporated in it is fa-miliar to those who participate. The notion of repetition is significant: the community re-turns time and again to the same stories, songs, formulae, and rituals. This creates a setting of stability and a sense of safety: one knows what to expect. In this way, the liturgy has the potential to become an anchor in people’s lives […]. Thus, in hagiographic texts, the liturgical wording functions as a hermeneutical key to the stories of the saints. By ex-tension, this wording enables the reader to understand not only the fate of the protagonist but also his or her own fate. As the life of the saint is illuminated by the liturgy, so is the life of the text’s recipient, because the context of the liturgy generated meaning on two levels. First, it offers a paraenetic model and encouragement for life on earth. Secondly, it creates hope and comfort based on the promise of a life to come.\n",

In concomitance with the increasing of the local hagiographic production, as mentioned above, the use of the large MTMs transmitting hagiographic collections, such as the Gadla Samāʿtāt and the Gadla Qǝddusān, started to decrease in favour of the diffusion of different MTM types, apparently more suitable to cope with the proliferation of the hagiographic texts in progress. These MTMs, smaller in size, offer various arrays of hagiographic collections, consisting of a few texts (usually fewer than a dozen). Aside from the study of some individual texts, the thousands of MTMs of this type have never been the object of systematic research in a broader per-spective, so crucial for understanding hagiographic, liturgical and veneration practices spread through the country at different times of the Ethiopian Chris-tian history.

Furthermore, some of these manuscripts also include a series of illuminations portraying the most representative episodes and miracles selected from the Lives of the saints.

If, for instance, the main celebration of a saint falls on 5 August, then the monthly celebration takes place on the 5th of each month. The whole hagiographic text is read on the day of the main tazkār and only a portion on the day of the monthly commemoration. This element is substantiat-ed in the MTMs, once again, by reading indications, in the form of paracontent, consisting of the name of the month written in the margins of the pages, in cor-respondence with the beginning of the text’s portion to be read during the monthly commemoration or even in its textual segmentation in distinct sections subsequently. It is not clear when the monthly commemoration of the saints was introduced in Ethiopia. Reading indications for performing the text on the monthly commemoration already appear in manuscripts dated to the end of the fifteenth century. This practice is still performed in Ethiopia today, together with a number of devotional ritual practices involving the use of hagiographic manuscripts.  \n",

      "level9\t ------------------It can be presumed that the progressive diffusion of small MTM forms mirrors a cultural change in the perception of Ethiopian sainthood, implying (1) a trans-formation in the authentication of holiness, where the miracles assume an in-creasing importance as evidence of the elevation to sainthood ‒ as is witnessed by the composition and the insertion of sections of miracles in the MTMs; and (2) a transformation in the liturgical commemoration practices, consisting of the introduction of the monthly commemoration of the saints, occurring on the same day of the annual commemoration but each month. The progressive emer-gence of smaller MTMs possibly coincides with a change in the ritual function of hagiographic works that, for this reason, needed to be accommodated in a dif-ferent manuscript form. An interesting aspect of this process concerns the com-position and addition of miracles to hagiographies of foreign saints copied from the larger to the smaller MTMs. These miracles (usually post-mortem) are set in Ethiopia, although these saints have never had any previous connection with the country. One might claim that the power of holiness goes beyond borders established by human beings. In actual fact (and without summoning meta-physical powers), this facet can be considered to be the reflection of the lively assimilation of foreign elements which characterises the Ethiopian culture in many aspects and mostly in literature, where translated texts were always ac-tively received and transformed to be adapted to the local culture. The composi-tion of the Ethiopian miracles has a double-sided connotation: (1) a literary meaning, i.e. the active reception of a model assimilated, digested and repur-posed in a customised form (a similar example is provided by the Miracles of Mary’s collection, translated in Gǝʿǝz and enriched with Ethiopian miracles);\n",

The effects of this course sometimes moved beyond the expected conse-quences.

      "level9\t ------------------The contemporary liturgical celebrations of the saints allow one to witness the actual practices and the way hagiographic manuscripts are used. The general rules are the same throughout the country, but some features may vary accord-ing to specific procedures in place in churches, districts or regions. The description which follows is based on field research I carried out in February 2017 and October 2018 in the area of Aksum (Tǝgrāy, north Ethiopia), where I had the opportunity to attend some ceremonies for the commemoration of the saints and interview Qes Ḫaylu Walda Giyorgis, a scribe and member of the regular clergy of Māryām Ṣǝyon cathedral, the beating heart of Ethiopian Christianity. In the area of Aksum, the ceremonies for the celebration of the saints’ tazkār are characterised by various readings and singings of texts trans-mitted in manuscripts, which are performed by the officiants partly inside and partly outside the church. All the singing and reading, including the Life of the saint, are regulated by the beginning of the liturgy of the mass (qǝddāse), which takes place: (1) on Mondays to Fridays before Easter between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m. and for two months after Easter between 6:00 and 8:30 a.m.; (2) on Saturdays between 8:00 and 10:30 a.m.; and (3) on Sundays between 6:00 and 8:30 a.m. This means that all the readings must be concluded before the start of the qǝddāse. Accordingly, they begin very early in the morning during the weeks before Easter, whereas on Saturdays, Sundays and in the six weeks after Easter they begin in the night. The officiants read part of the following manuscripts inside the church: the Gospel, the Zemā, the Mazgab, the Miracles of Mary, the Miracles of Jesus and the Kidān. Then the priests, along with the people attend-ing the ceremony, move outside the church, into an area called the ʿawda mǝḫrat (‘court of mercy’), where the reading of the hagiographic manuscripts is performed. The reason for reading the manuscript outside the church is appar-ently due to a specific ground, that is, to allow everyone who wishes to hear the Life of the saint to take part in the reading and, above all, the faithful who, for various motivations, are banned from entering the church, for instance, people who have committed severe crimes or are divorced. Saints are egalitarian and inclusive; they do not discriminate against anyone. \n",

In addition, the officiant can optionally spell the names of other saints celebrated on the same day. The officiant initially reads a portion of the manuscripts in the Gǝʿǝz lan-guage and then he (or some other priests) translates or paraphrases its words into the local spoken language (Tigrinya, in this case). This is due to the fact that nowadays laypeople do not understand Gǝʿǝz, the classical language of Ethiopia that survives only in the liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tawāḥǝdo Church. After reading the text, the officiant stands with the manuscript in his hands and the faithful attending the ceremony move towards him to receive his bless-ing.

In practical terms, the charisma of individual saints are detectable either from specific miracles they have per-formed or specific episodes of their Life, both recorded and transmitted in man-uscripts. There are saints who are able to handle the weather conditions, others that can heal specific diseases or cure infertility, and many others could be listed. Saint Zamikāʾel ʾAragāwi, for instance, has the power to heal people who have been poisoned by being bitten by a snake. The charisma attributed to him possibly originates from a passage of his Life detailing how he was able to reach the top of a high mountain, where he chose to dwell: he ordered a big snake that appeared to him in the sky to lower its tail and used it as a rope to climb up the mountain.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------144\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ In actual practice, the charismas of the saints are released during specific healing rituals in which the manuscripts transmitting their hagiography are involved. In these rituals, the hagiographic manuscripts have a central role in the per-formance. In principle, depending on the kind of ritual, manuscripts can be rubbed on the body of the patient, put under the pillow in case the patient is confined to bed, carried on the back of women like a child to cure infertility,\n",

Protective scrolls can, for instance, be worn by pregnant women, in correspondence to their womb, to protect them from abortion and their children from cot death. In this case, the ritual is not performed when the scroll is worn but when it is produced. Any sort of illness is generally ascribed to attacks by demons in traditional Ethiopian society. The aim of the ritual is to defeat the demons, and the manuscript is the most power-ful medium, besides holy water and prayer, to do that. The saint makes genuine use of their power by interceding through the manuscript, and the manuscript assures the presence of the saint at the exact moment in which it is needed. What follows is the brief description of one of these rituals reported to me in November 2016 by ʾAbbā Surāfel ʾAsaffā, a monk from the monastic community of Dabra Madarā (ʿAdwā, Tǝgrāy), a monastery founded by the monk ʾAbbā Garimā. In fact, the ritual involves precisely the saint ʾAbbā Garimā, who has, among other charismas, the power to heal fields affected by parasites. I suppose that this charisma derives from at least two famous miracles of the saint. In the first miracle, Garimā sows seeds of wheat that germinate and ripen in a few hours. The wheat is collected and partly used for the Eucharistic sacrifice and \n",

      "level12\t ------------------------147\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The ritual is performed to heal fields when the crop does not grow as it should. The farmers address the monastery of Garimā and ask for a healing ritual. Two priests and three deacons from the monastery go to the field, which is the setting for the ritual, bringing with them (1) the manuscript containing the Life of Garimā, (2) a processional cross, (3) incense, (4) a censer, (5) the ceremo-nial garments, (6) holy water, and (7) at least one processional umbrella to pro-tect the manuscript from the sun or rain. After a sequence of prayers (it is al-ways the same in this kind of ritual), one of the priests starts to read from the manuscript the Life of the saint. Then, the priests and the deacons take the manuscript in procession clockwise around the field three times. During the procession, the manuscript is kept in the hands of one of the priests; the last deacon in line sprinkles the holy water on the field (the ṣabal, ‘the soil collected from the monastery of the saint’, is sometimes added to the holy water); the second priest lets the smoke of the incense rise over the field using his right hand and, simultaneously, holds the processional cross in his left hand. After the procession, they perform the burāke, a ritual blessing formula, usually transmitted orally, that is created and adapted each time according to the cir-cumstances of the ritual. The ceremony can be repeated if the first attempt does not achieve the desired results. Once the farmers harvest the healed field, they offer a portion of the crop to the monastery of Garimā as a token of gratitude. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------In consideration of the assumed role of the manuscript in the authentication of holiness in late antique and medieval Ethiopia, the circulation of the hagio-graphic MTMs must have contributed to the diffusion of the saints’ memory and veneration throughout the country. The distribution of the MTMs containing the Acts of the saints and, even more, Acts of the martyrs and Synaxarion stands in direct proportion to the importance of these collections. Each monastery pos-sessed at least one copy. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------The documentation collected and examined so far, allows a preliminary identification of at least four phases in the genesis of the formation and trans-mission of the ‘parchment saints’. The first phase (from the thirteenth to fourteenth century onwards) attests the accomplished acquisition of a corpus of texts about foreign saints translated into Gǝʿǝz and transmitted in MTMs, with a peak of dissemination occurring between the fourteenth and sixteenth century. The fama sanctitatis of these saints was already officially and universally ascertained and their hagi-ographies, already used for their liturgical commemorations in other Christian countries (and in other languages), were also read in Ethiopia during the litur-gical celebrations. The second phase (from the end of the fourteenth century onwards) dis-plays the progressive inclusion in these MTMs of hagiographies about local saints. Unlike the foreign saints, these local saints were not blessed with an acknowledged fama sanctitatis. It can be presumed that the insertion of their hagiographies in MTMs transmitting texts about saints universally recognised aimed at the authentication and acceptance of their sainthood and the promo-tion of their liturgical veneration beyond the boundaries of their respective local communities. The third phase (from the sixteenth century onwards) can be considered a further implementation of the previous phase: the translation, from Arabic into Gǝʿǝz, of the second recension of the Synaxarion accommodated in MTMs with a less rigid material structure (short texts which, in solely two volumes, enabled the coverage of the liturgical celebrations of the saints for each day of the whole liturgical year) allowed the association of a great number of local saints to the foreign saints, thus, elevating the former to sainthood. The introduction of the Synaxarion into the liturgy made the recognition of a wide number of local saints possible (although some of them were and are only remembered by their name and their commemoration date); different versions of the Synaxarion were produced, each of them including both ‘famous’ and ‘less famous’ saints, con-tributing to the legitimisation of local cults. Even nowadays, in remote areas, specific versions of the Synaxarion exist including saints only venerated at a local level that are evidence of local venerations practices. This evidence sup-ports the hypothesis that the production and liturgical use of some specific manuscripts contributed to the official authorisation to holiness. The fourth phase (from the sixteenth to seventeenth century onwards) gradually sees the diffusion of smaller MTMs forms, although sporadic evidence \n",

      "level10\t -------------------- | Antonella Brita \n",

      "level12\t ------------------------148\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The flexibility of this manuscript format permits each man-uscript to host not only the hagiography but also additional texts devoted to the saints, such as miracles and poetic compositions (salām, malkǝʾ). There are hagiographies on both local and foreign saints in these MTMs, integrating the latter into the local culture. The hagiographies of the Aksumite saints were initially included in manu-scripts also containing foreign hagiographies. The co-presence of new texts alongside those already known for a long time probably aimed at facilitating the circulation and liturgical use of the former. This process of diffusion implied that the foreign hagiographies deeply influenced the local hagiographies on the Aksumite saints, which were created out of the medieval adaptation of late antique traditions. No written evidence about these saints survived from the ancient period, if there were ever any at all. An example of this process is pro-vided by the Life of the saint Ṗanṭalewon zaṣomāʿt. The study of the extension of the veneration practices connected to the in-dividual saints in late antique and medieval Ethiopia is only at its beginning. The comparison between the ancient manuscript sources and the observation of the contemporary set of conditions reveals some interesting hagiographic phe-nomena that need a deeper investigation to be understood in their entire dia-chronic evolution. (1) For instance, there are saints who were commemorated in the Middle Ages quite extensively ‒ as the spatial distribution of MTMs trans-mitting their hagiographies reveals ‒ but that nowadays are commemorated only in the areas where the monasteries built in their name are found (e.g. Ṗanṭalewon zaṣomāʿt). (2) There are saints who have always been largely com-memorated, from the early medieval period till now (e.g. Qirqos). (3) There are saints whose commemoration has never been extensive ‒ their hagiographies, attested only in MTMs, are very rare ‒ and, at a certain point, ceased to exist (e.g. ʾAbākluz, James the Intercisus). (4) And there are saints whose commemo-ration does not follow a continuum, instead, it is attested in the medieval period and, after a break of several centuries, was revitalised in recent times, becoming pervasively observed (e.g. ʾArsimā). Other examples could be mentioned. In conclusion, the process of writing, (re-)elaborating, assembling, structur-ing, copying and performing hagiographic texts within MTMs aims at creating institutional devices, namely, specific kinds of manuscripts, to be used for ritual purposes and conveying evidence of authorised sainthood. These manuscripts collect more hagiographies, each with peculiar characteristics, which offer an \n",

The liturgical use of these MTMs ‒ explained through paracontents ‒ performs a social function: the repetitive ritual reading, listening and experiencing of the saints’ charisma make the ex-empla part of the collective self-consciousness and memory and continuously reconfirm their importance for the benefit of the members of the community. The transmission of these manuscripts, thus, provides a complex of shared edifying virtues, builds up a shared moral code among the members of the community, which is instrumental in establishing and perpetrating the religious laws in ritual form, and in safeguarding the social equilibrium.

      "level9\t ------------------Abstract: In contrast to what is commonly regarded as ‘literature’ or ‘poetry’, renga (‘linked verse’) is not only composed in a group, but ‘performed’ by its members. This performance, which follows certain rules, involves the produc-tion of manuscripts, which have been subject to certain rules themselves in the course of history. Focusing on renga in Classical Japanese, this paper outlines the process behind both a pre-modern and a contemporary renga session and describes how manuscripts are created and used in these procedures and in which larger performative and ritual contexts these actions are embedded. Fi-nally, an examination is made of the extent to which Western concepts of ‘per-formance’ from performance theory are applicable to these procedures and what traditional Japanese terminology is available to describe them. \n",

The reading is indicated by reading aids (furigana) in Kuroiwa 2016, 30, as it was probably in the notes taken at the renga session. The romanisation used here respects the fact that historical orthography is used in renga. Araharete (‘appeared’) is pro-nounced arawarete in Modern Japanese. \n",

The renga session was conducted at Susa Jinja Shrine in Yukuhashi (Fu-kuoka prefecture, Kyūshū). The text has been divided into paragraphs and translated into English by myself. 6 Japanese is a mora-based language. Put simply, a mora is a short syllable. In phonology, it has repeatedly been described as a time unit (for a history of the concept, see Kubozono 2015) and a ‘unit that measures syllable weight’ (Kubozono 2015, 3). Japanese morae have a CV (conso-nant–vowel) structure. This structure is represented by the hiragana and katakana syllabaries. \n",

The narrative indicates – albeit only in a small note (‘first sheet recto’) – that this involved the production of manuscripts. This pa-per will explore what ‘performing renga’ means and what place manuscripts have in such ‘performances’. The main focus will be on contemporary practice, based on a research trip I conducted in the summer of 2018.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ First of all, an in-troduction to the basic rules of renga composition will be provided here, along with a short history of the genre and brief description of traditional and modern paper formats. Next, I will outline the basic elements of a pre-modern and a contemporary renga meeting. Since there are many different types of renga and the way in which the sessions were carried out (and still are) varies accordingly, this can only be done as a model abstraction. A closer look will be taken at the submission of verses, which is the most important part of the procedure. There are basically two ways of adding verses in contemporary renga circles: an oral and a written procedure. My paper concludes with some reflections on what ‘performing’ means in general and what equivalent concepts exist in Japan. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------A renga poem starts with the first verse, or hokku, usually contributed by the guest of honour, often the host of the party in pre-modern Japan. Nowadays, it may be an important member of the circle or the master (sōshō) himself.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------9\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The hokku is a ‘long verse’ of seventeen morae to which another person adds the second verse, or wakiku. A wakiku is a ‘short verse’ of fourteen morae.

      "level12\t ------------------------11\n",

The most common forms consist of thirty-six vers-es, forty-four (which is called a yoyoshi 世吉 poem), a hundred verses (called a hyakuin 百韻, i.e. fifty pairs containing of seventeen and fourteen morae), a thousand and ten thousand verses. In modern Japan, forty-four is the most common form for a neoclassical renga poem, while the thirty-six-verse form, or kasen, is generally used for renku (modern renga).\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------12\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Shorter forms like half a kasen or half a yoyoshi are produced as well. A twelve-verse form is used in children’s renga. Apart from the alternation of long and short verses mentioned above, the poem and the composing process are subject to different sets of rules and con-ventions: 1. Poetic rules and genre norms (shikimoku \n",
      "level10\t --------------------式目\n",
      "level9\t ------------------): the basic ‘grammar’ of renga consists of a ‘classification of poetic motifs’ or semantic categories (bu-date),\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------13\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ rules about how many verses with the same motif may appear in a row (kukazu, or ‘number of verses’), and rules about how many verses cer-tain motifs have to be separated by until they can be used again (kusari). Moreover, each verse is related to one of the four seasons of the year or is designated as being in a fifth category, zō 雑, a ‘seasonless verse’ (lit. ‘mis-cellaneous’). The seasons are subject to the same kind of restrictions as po-etic motifs.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------14\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Another basic requirement in traditional or ‘neoclassical’ renga is that the wording of the poetry should be similar to the classic courtly lan-guage of waka poetry and that historical orthography should be used. Neol-ogisms, foreign words and words in Sino-Japanese reading (onyomi) are largely avoided in neoclassical renga; they are allowed to some degree in \n",
      "level10\t --------------------|| 11 Although each verse has to be an independent unit, two adjacent verses (the first and second, second and third, etc.) are linked together, thereby creating a succession of constantly changing images. The linking was and is governed by principles of combination known as tsukeai (‘adding to each other’) and yoriai (lit. ‘approaching each other’, i.e. ‘association’), which have changed over time just like other rules and conventions. 12 See n. 15 below. 13 Amongst other things, such poetic categories can include shining things (hikari mono), time (jibun), things that rise (sobiki mono, e.g. mist), things that fall (furimono, e.g. rain and snow), hills and mountains (sanrui), plants (shokubutsu) or humans (jinrin). 14 ‘Spring’ has to be continued for three verses, for example, but it can only be continued for a maximum of five. \n",

Implementing rules (sahō 作法): pre-modern renga sessions were much more ritualised than they are today; many books were written describing rules for conducting the circles (kaiseki sahō) and rules on decorum (reigi sahō). As in the past, a typical renga circle these days consists of a master (sōshō) who guides the performance, a scribe (shuhitsu) who records the poem as it emerges, and the group of poets who create the poems (renjū or renju). Pre-modern rule books put special emphasis on rules describing the actions of the scribe (shuhitsu sahō), amongst other things.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------16\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Implementa-tion rules and rules of decorum are by no means obsolete in contemporary renga performances, but they are less ritualised than they used to be. 3.

The art in its classical form especially flourished in the five hundred years between the thirteenth and seventeenth century, but it continued to be practised until the middle of the nineteenth century and to a lesser degree until the beginning of the twentieth century before it was finally abandoned in most parts of Japan – albeit with the exception of a small parish in the city of Yukuhashi on the island of Kyūshū.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------20\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ A revival movement was started from this parish in the 1980s, which led to renga being practised again in many places in Japan. Today, many circles are in contact with one another, and participants of one circle also often attend the sessions held by other circles (especially in the case of annual sessions). It goes without saying that renga poetry was subject to changes over such a long period and that the genre has developed several forms and varieties as a literary work and performative practice that cannot be covered in this short paper. Suffice it to say that the haikai no renga, which developed from the end of the sixteenth century onwards, was mainly practised by the bourgeoisie and the merchant class and is now practised in its modern form, renku, these days.\n",

Whether there were other minor exceptions re-mains a topic for future research. See Buck-Albulet 2020, 13. 21 Classical renga, on the other hand, was mainly practised by the samurai class and in shrines and temples. Another form of linked verse practiced in pre-modern Japan was a mixed Sino-Japanese form called wakan rengu (see Hasegawa 2006). 22 Clean copies were also made according to what kind of renga or renga session took place. Some were written on lavishly decorated kaishi (for dedicating to a deity, for example), scrolls (for archiving outstanding poems) or booklets, depending on their purpose or the occasion for which they were created.

The first round was often practised before the actual renga meeting took place, which means that the first few verses of the renga were not composed at the meeting place itself, but wherever the invited partici-pants decided to work on them. In this case, a messenger was sent to the homes of the invited guests with a box containing a paper sheet and collected a verse from each person.

      "level9\t ------------------ In some modern renga circles like the monthly one held at Kumata Shrine in Osa-ka, the roles of the scribe and master are entrusted to experienced members of the group on a rotational basis. Because many contemporary renga poets are less experienced than their pre-modern predecessors, a renga session may last anything between three and five hours, even though the standard length of a modern poem is only forty-four verses rather than a hundred. It is also quite common for a yoyoshi to take two or more sessions to be completed. As in pre-modern renga, a ‘first round’ is sometimes held before the actual session. How-ever, in our digital era, the scribe or renga master no longer sends a messenger to the participants’ homes to pick up each person’s verse. Rather, he or she collects the verses by using modern media like the telephone, email or instant messaging (this is called bun’in 文韻, lit. ‘written rhyme’ in Japanese).

See Hiroki 2006b; Koyama 2014. 46 This is due to the fact that renga has become so important as a votive practice. As I have argued in Buck-Albulet 2020 (see especially 8 and 28–30), this is probably the main reason why the practice still exists. 47 In present-day Japan, many renga circles are associated with a shrine (and some of them with a temple), but there are also circles that meet in a secular environment like the one at Hirano Library in Osaka (a branch of Osaka Municipal Central Library). In pre-modern Japan, there were circles at shrines and temples as well as ‘secular’ circles that were held for various reasons.

      "level9\t ------------------ Even in sessions where the group produces all the verses in presence (i.e. all members are present in the meeting), the first round can involve the members composing verses one after the other before they switch to the competitive part. However, if the scribe or renga master notic-es towards the end of the renga session that there is a participant who has not submitted a verse yet, he or she may specifically request one from that person, who may then be helped by the other members; as competitive as renga can be, nobody gets left behind or left out.\n",

This is regarded as an expression of the group’s collaborative spirit, even though the contributions are still provided competitively. No tally is kept in such cases. 51 The terms are not very accurate because the participants may also use tanzaku to make drafts in the vocal-style procedure, while in the tanzaku style, there is a vocal element as well: the selected verses are read out from the tanzaku or kaishi by the scribe. \n",

They are permitted to watch it from outside, however. See Buck-Albulet 2020, 11. \n",

The verses are then written on a whiteboard together with the name of the child. It is interesting to note that the ‘linking’ is not done by the little poets in this case, but by the adults combining the tanzaku. Finally, tanzaku strips made of precious paper are used to write single verses of renga, for instance to donate the poem to a temple or shrine as an offering.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------62\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ 6.3.3 Comparing the two styles As it will have become clear from the description above, none of the procedures are entirely in writing or entirely oral; they are all mixed forms. There is a clear difference between the oral and the tanzaku style, however, in terms of their temporal structure and the group’s shared experience. In the oral-style proce-dure, only one participant can speak at a time. In order to submit a verse, he (or she) has to indicate his intention by raising their hand or making another ges-ture.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ The proposal he makes is heard by every member of the circle and thus creates a common aural experience.

A verse may also be rejected orally or ‘returned’ for further improvement and then submitted again and finally accepted. In contrast, several submissions may be made at the same time in tanzaku-style renga.

See Tsurusaki 2010, 66–68. 63 In the unique ‘renga on the float’ (shajō renga) in Yukuhashi, which is also a kasagi renga and part of the Gion festival renga in summer, people would come forward to the microphone. In pre-modern sessions, a fan was used to indicate one’s willingness to submit a verse. See Buck-Albulet 2021, 170. 64 The didactic style used at Hirano Library in Osaka is an exception as the tanzaku are dis-played to everyone by means of a document camera.

      "level9\t ------------------Before we sum up what it might mean to ‘perform’ renga, it is necessary to con-sider some Japanese concepts that can be regarded as being equivalent to the English notions of ‘performing’ and ‘performance’. Japanese researchers have described renga as an ‘art of the place’ (za no bungei 坐の文芸 or ba no bungei 場の文芸), i.e. an art that requires several peo-ple to meet at a given time and place. This point can hardly be emphasised enough: za and ba mean much more than just a physical location. Za refers to the location and, at the same time, to the social union of the group\n",

Za is therefore the place of a collective, supra-individual activity and experience as well. The time and venue of a renga session both influence the content of the first verse (the hokku) considerably as it is the only verse in the poem to refer to the real world or the actual circumstances in which the performance takes place,\n",

Writing words in kana, for instance, can increase the possibility of ambiguous reading and thus enhance the possibilities for the next link. Moreover, unusual readings for Kanji may also be used. Orthography is therefore an important part of poetic ex-pression. 66 Hiroki 2004, 444. 67 This expression is from Kaneko Kinjirō, quoted in Hiroki 2004, 216. 68 The second verse is also affected by the situation to some degree as it has to respond to the hokku. 69 However, I have noticed several times that verses alluded to current events as well.

Unlike poetry in general, which is basically considered to be the expression of authentic emotions, renga is considered fiction and could therefore be described as a kind of ‘persona poetry’ in the sense that the verses are written from the viewpoint of a fictive lyrical subject. Moreover, renga may be embedded in much larger performative settings like annual festivals in the context of which other arts or rituals are performed. As mentioned above, in the case of religious renga (hōraku renga or hōnō renga), the session is followed by a ceremony in which the poem is recited from a man-uscript before the deities and a kaishi is dedicated to them and stored at the respective shrine or temple (see Fig. 8).  \n",

Traditional manuscripts have been the material carriers on which the literary products have come down to us. Because of their material (paper quality), visual quality (painting, calligraphy) and structural qualities (the 8-14-14-8-verse scheme), they can develop their own aesthetics and agency. Once the 8-14 pattern of distributing verses on the pages was established, it not only started to influence the content of the poem, but it also gave rise to a meth-od of text organisation that persisted, although traditional kaishi largely ceased to be written during the sessions. Terms for the pages of traditional kaishi have become terms for the ‘parts of speech’ of renga: ‘first sheet recto’ (shoori omote) as mentioned by Kuroiwa above has become a synonym for ‘the first eight vers-es’, for instance. While the act of composing is based on the poetic side of crea-tivity, writing on the kaishi allows handwritten, calligraphic and pictorial crea-tivity to be expressed. The act of composing, the recitation and the manuscript with the poem written in it can jointly serve as a gift to the deities.

      "level9\t ------------------Abstract: This paper explores liturgical practice involving medieval liturgical books used by the Latin Church and considers their materiality and use. Starting from a general definition of liturgy, liturgical practice and liturgical books, it analyses medieval books as ‘containers’ of texts which prescribe ritual actions, it examines practices involving liturgical books and it acknowledges artisanal traditions in the making of liturgical manuscripts. \n",

It involves people – the clergy and laymen – as well as liturgical objects, including books, and it is performed in ceremonies and rites that involve moves, gestures and voices. During the Middle Ages, rituals in the Latin Church shaped the basic structure of society and moulded the identity of each individual and, indeed, the commu-nity as a whole. The study of liturgical performance can therefore help us un-derstand medieval social structures and relations.\n",

It encom-passed the Mass, the Office and other kinds of ritual practices celebrated in a Christian community, such as baptisms, marriages, funerals and processions.

      "level9\t ------------------action had a huge impact on Christian book production, and liturgical books display specific features that are closely connected with their function, their use and their users and that reflect a particular practice. In the field of liturgical studies, a practice is an action that is structured and organised within a specific temporal and special context. The liturgical calendar regulates the ritual time frame, which is organised in periods (based on the principal feasts like Christmas and Easter), in weeks, with a weekly liturgical structure based on the recitation of the psalter, and in hours, which include the Mass, the daily and night Office and other occasional ceremonies. In this sense, there is a liturgical norm that regulates when and how a ceremony has to be performed. This does not mean that the liturgical practice is the same for each religious institution, though. In fact, ‘liturgical use’ changes according to the tradition that has been adopted by a diocese, a cathedral, a collegiate, a monas-tery or a religious order; practices differ in terms of their prayers and lectures, in their chants and melodies, in the order of actions and in the ministers and plac-es that are involved.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------4\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Consequently, specific liturgical books were designed and copied to provide support for local liturgical performances. Practice can be seen in a variety of perspectives within the liturgical frame-work: on one hand, liturgical ceremonies could be regarded in their ‘choreo-graphic’ aspect, which implies the use of books as guides on the text and music, while, on the other hand, liturgical books are the result of a practice that defines their shape and the organisation of their content according to their function within and outside the ritual performance. This article intends to investigate the place of liturgical performance in relation to liturgical manuscripts by looking at three main aspects: the making of liturgy as prescribed in liturgical books, the use of the books themselves within a liturgical action and the strategies employed in making liturgical manuscripts. \n",
      "level4\t --------2 Liturgical practice in manuscripts \n",

Actions like benedictions, genuflexions, signs of the cross or walking in processions and even writing are contemplated in the universe of liturgical gestures; voices are important to the extent that they express the verbum, or holy word, which is either proclaimed or sung. Rubrics also indicate the time when a particular service has to be held and to how manage collisions between feasts. The Ordines romani are among the most ancient documents of the Latin Church\n",

They were written between the sixth and tenth century and left traces in the ordinals and pontificals that were copied from the tenth and eleventh century. The Ordines romani reflect the state of the Franco-Roman liturgy before the tenth century and are valuable witnesses of early liturgical practice. They describe in detail how the ordinals should be performed and provide particulars about the ministers, specific places to be used in or outside the church, liturgical vestments and the objects that needed to be employed during such ceremonies. Of all the liturgical books in use, the Gospel was the object of particular veneration. The Ordo romanus primus, describing the papal Mass, assigns the epistolary to the sub-deacon and the Gospel book to the archdeacon.\n",

      "level10\t --------------------|| 5 Rubrics are prescriptive texts that were added to liturgical books and sometimes collated in proper sections.

This kind of book states the exact sequence of texts and actions, but it cannot be used alone in the Mass or the Office. Sometimes rubrics are far longer, especially when a series of complex actions have to be performed.

Ordinals were basically created to provide a guide for the intricate jungle of major and minor feasts, newly canonised saints, changes in the importance of feasts and local solemnities. Some of its rubrics migrated in later missals and breviaries and formed a series of prescriptions known as Ordo missae and Ordo officii.

The whole cere-mony, which starts the day before with the enclosure of the relics, involves the bishop, the clergy and the laypeople in such a manner that each action is strict-ly organised and has to be performed at a specific time and place. What is par-ticular about this ritual is the specific interaction between the ritual practice and the writing gesture at the moment the new church is consecrated. In this part, the bishop and the clergy are in the church while the lay people are wait-ing outside; this secret ritual implies the prostration of the bishop on the ground while the clergy is singing, the processional benediction of the internal walls with the holy water, and the enclosure of the relics in the altar.

The alphabets traced by the bishop not only represent the various levels of understanding, but they also reflect a learning practice that dates from Late Antiquity. Manuscripts play a huge role in transmitting traces of medieval liturgical practices to us. The extremely large number of prescriptions and rubrics served as a basis for the development of liturgical actions, but most of all, the Ordo missae and the Ordo officii provided essential instruments for what could be called ‘time management’. As we know, the liturgical year is based upon a se-ries of feasts, either fixed-date feasts like Christmas, Epiphany and the feasts of saints or moveable-date feasts (Sundays, Easter, Pentecost, etc.). Their interac-tion sometimes caused issues if two important feasts fell on the same day. Moreover, the development of the Sanctoral Cycle in the Late Middle Ages caused several problems in managing liturgical ceremonies. Let us look at the beginning of the liturgical year now for an example of this kind of concern. If the first Sunday of Advent falls on 30 November when the feast of St Andrew occurs, it has to be decided whether the daily Mass and Office should be that of the Sunday or that of St Andrew and which feast should pre-vail over the other one. In these cases, more than one solution may be proposed, depending on the importance of each feast: the less important one may be sup-pressed or moved to the following day, or some element of one feast and of the other could be performed in the same ceremony. The breviary of Sens (Paris, BnF, Latin 1028), for example, has an Ordo of-ficii which takes any possible scenario into account.

In the year when Christmas falls on a Sunday, there are four weeks in Advent, and in the third week there is the fasting of the Four Times, namely on Wednesday, Friday and Sat-urday, and on Tuesday of the third week there is the feast of Saint Lucy and on Monday of the same week the first responsory of matins is ‘Ecce apparebit’, the second is ‘Bethleem’. \n",
      "level9\t ------------------So, if Christmas falls on a Sunday, then Advent lasts four full weeks, Advent Sundays are on 27 November and 4, 11 and 18 December, and the feast of St Lucy (13 December) falls on the Tuesday (feria tertia) of the third week. This third week of Advent is one of four weeks spread over the year with a special peniten-tial liturgy called Quatuor tempora, where fasting is prescribed on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

      "level9\t ------------------This case leads to a completely different situation where Advent is six days shorter and some ferial days have to be omitted. The Sundays in Advent fall on 3, 10, 17 and 24 December, and this last Sunday coincides with Christmas Eve, which causes some issues with the organisation of the liturgy. The compiler of this Ordo officii seemed very concerned about how to regulate the dates of St Lucy (13 December) and St Thomas (21 December) with the different feasts of Advent. To fully understand why these two particular feasts are so problematic, we need to refer to the liturgical calendar, which is provided at the beginning of the manuscript. In fact, among all the feasts that are included in the Advent period, St Lucy is marked as a feast of nine lessons, which implies a certain solemnity, and that of St Thomas is a duplex feast, which constitutes the second highest degree of solemnity in Sens.

      "level12\t ------------------------22\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Here the problem specifically concerns the feasts of St Lucy and St Thomas because, depending on the year, they may fall in the third week, that of the Four Times, and thus provoke a contradiction between a solemn celebration and a penitential time, or even a fasting day, which is precisely what happened to St Thomas when Christmas fell on a Tuesday.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------23\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The usefulness of the Ordo is therefore self-evident: it is a valuable instrument that can help the celebrant to solve any is-sues caused by overlapping feasts that call for different degrees of solemnity. The liturgical practice is described in varying detail on the pages of a liturgical manuscript, to the extent that it has to be performed: the book is a point of ref-erence, a guide, a support and a physical container for the text. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------A liturgical book can also be seen in another light, namely as an integral part of a religious ceremony and an essential element in constructing a daily religious practice. Not all liturgical books were used during a liturgical ceremony, how-ever: the Gospel, for example, could simply be displayed rather than read, like the famous Book of Kells (Dublin, Trinity College, MS 58), where the initial pag-es are so decorated that the text literally disappears in the innovative interplay of light and shade produced by the colours and gold ink. It was not essential to read the text, but it was important to see it and contemplate it as the verbum Dei.\n",

However, each diocese tended to develop its own way of organising feasts, with different nuances between the major feasts (duplex maius and minus, simplex, annuale, etc.). 23 There are two other major feasts in December, namely that of St Andrew and that of St Nicolas, both of which are duplex, but these feasts (on 30 November and 6 December respec-tively) never fall on the third week of Advent. 24 This case is quite different from other luxuriously decorated Gospels such as the Drogo Gospel (Paris, BnF, Latin 9388), where the ivory plaque in the binding or fully illuminated pages are beside pages of text with decorated initials; in the Book of Kells, it is the text that is transformed in a decorated page, to the extent that the text itself is no longer recognisable. \n",

The monumental size of the Codex Amiatinus (Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Amiatinus 1), a giant Bible copied at the Wearmouth-Jarrow monastery in Northumbria at the end of the seventh century, tells us that this manuscript was probably not used during liturgy even though it contains some rubrics (possibly copied from the antigraph) that may suggest it was.\n",

Isaiah was read during Advent, Jeremiah from Pas-sion Sunday to Easter Sunday and Ezekiel, Daniel and the minor prophets in November. The division into lessons was added by a later hand, but what makes us absolutely certain that it is a ‘liturgical Bible’ is the fact that the Lamenta-tions of Jeremiah sung during the triduum sacrum display musical notation copied by the first hand. If monumental Bibles – intended either for liturgical or non-liturgical purposes – seem to have been the norm in the early Middle Ages, the panorama of biblical manuscripts changed dramatically with the creation of universities and the mendicant orders.

During the preceding centuries, the Bible at Montecassino was copied in separate sets of biblical books (Ottateuch, Prophets, Sapiential Books, etc.). See Casavecchia, Maniaci and Orofino 2021. 27 Parisian Bibles produced in great number during the second half of the thirteenth century are characterised by their compactness since the whole text of the Bible is reduced to fit into a small manuscript and by a much greater standardisation in the choice and order of biblical books.

Its portable size made it easy to carry while travel-ling and guaranteed the text would always be readily accessible for quick con-sultation. We can exclude the possibility of it having a liturgical use, though. The presence of some Bible-missals and Bible-breviaries ‒ i.e. manuscripts that contain a Bible and a missal or breviary ‒ has recently been emphasised, how-ever, triggering new questions and opening new fields of investigation.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------ The Bible itself has a plurality of functions that impact on its size, text lay-out, codicological features and illumination. The case of the Bible sounds very particular since we are dealing with a kind of book that has multiple meanings, functions and uses. Liturgical books could have been intended for a much sim-pler purpose, namely to structure a ceremony, but a close examination of differ-ent types of liturgical books reveals a much more nuanced situation than that. Let us examine Rome, Santa Sabina, XIV L 1 now, a manuscript better known as ‘the Dominican prototype’. It could be defined as a totum, i.e. a book containing all the texts that are necessary for the performance of the Dominican liturgy, both the Mass and Office. There are two other examples of this kind of book as well: the so-called Cistercian prototype (manuscript Dijon, Bibliothèque municipale, Ms. 114) and the totum of Piacenza, Biblioteca Capitolare, 65. From a structural point of view, the three manuscripts are all liturgical, but from an operative point of view, they were never actually used in liturgy. The first two manuscripts served as an ‘exemplar’, i.e. a reference work for copying other books. This procedure was supposed to ensure the uniformity of liturgical books, which was a concern for Cistercians as well as Dominicans. It is quite likely that the Piacenza totum had the same use; this is partially confirmed by the unusual content of the book, which preserves not only all the texts for the Mass and Office, but a computus and some text on music theory. As we have seen, books of great size were usually ‘show-books’ or ‘refer-ence books’, while small books were intended for individual use. This general assumption leads to some important questions the moment changes in the size of a book become a general tendency; a great number of pocket Bibles were produced in the second half of the thirteenth century, for example. In the very same period, there is another type of book that followed the same trend – a book that contains the texts for the Office known as the breviary.\n",

During the thirteenth century, the spread of Dominican and – most of all – Franciscan or-ders gave strength to a new form of devotion and piety that is reflected in the importance conferred to the Office, to Marian reverence and to individual pray-ers. By the fourteenth century, clergymen were required to say the Daily Office, which may explain the increase in the production of small breviaries. Private recitation of the Office spread beyond the clergy, though, catching on among laypeople, and several pocket breviaries were copied for members of high-ranking families (the breviary of Charles V, for example, manuscript Paris, BnF, Latin 1052). The complex system of liturgical rules was hard for non-religious people to follow, however, which is why the appropriation of devotional prac-tice by laymen led to the creation of a prayer book that looks like an excerpt from the breviary initially: the book of hours, which was a huge success in the fourteenth and particularly the fifteenth century. The contents of the book of hours – generally, the offices of the Virgin Mary, of the Dead, of the Cross and of the Holy Spirit, the litanies, some gospel read-ings and the penitential psalms – put this book outside the structure of the li-turgical year: being able to avoid all the liturgical rules on the overlapping of feast days made the book of hours much easier to use than the breviary. The lack of any liturgical norm (which was eventually imposed by the ecclesiastical authorities) stimulated the creativity of the scribes and owners, who experi-mented with new forms of piety and communication using original texts, either in Latin or in vernacular languages. The difference between the breviary and the book of hours lies not only in their respective content and structure, but in their function and the practice they reflect. The breviary was preferably copied in religious circles, while the book of hours was entrusted to professional workshops; the breviary was used in the liturgy where it was recited collectively or individually; the book of hours was only intended for private use outside a liturgical setting; the text of the breviary was subject to control by the ecclesiastical authority, which validated its conformity with the use and updates of the liturgy, whereas the book of hours was the privileged place for creating new devotional texts. The differences between the breviary and the book of hours seem to be per-fectly clear in terms of their dynamics, text and operational phases. However, let us consider the case of a number of breviaries that are liturgical with respect to their content, but that were not actually used during the Office in medieval times. These breviaries were copied for members of the royal family in France, like the breviary Paris, BnF, Latin 1288, written in the middle of the fourteenth \n",

      "level9\t ------------------ Despite their content, books of this kind never had a liturgical use, nor were they supposed to be used by the clergy. In this respect, it is essential to identify the recipient of a liturgical book in order to understand its inherent nature and the practice involving books, which is deduced from paratextual elements such as decoration and marks of ownership. In this case, books with the same content were intended to be used in very different con-texts. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------The appearance of a liturgical manuscript, i.e. its external or internal facies, is the outcome of a series of more or less conscious choices in the making of the book. In fact, scribal practices regarding liturgical books are partly linked to the tradition of a scriptorium and partly to the content of the book. The script, the colours, the illumination and the layout are the result of a series of economical, aesthetical and social constraints and the perpetuation of customary procedures. Take Paris, BnF, NAL 300 and Troyes, Médiathèque Jacques Chirac, 1732, for example (see Table 1). These are both breviaries and are identical in size, but the way in which they display their contents is very different. The first one, a brev-iary from fourteenth-century Bordeaux, has twenty-seven lines in two columns in a small gothic script and a high level of exploitation of the page, while the second, a Cistercian breviary from Clairvaux, has twelve long lines written in a large, round gothic script, with each page containing a small amount of text. The reason for such different choices is linked to the quite conservative scribal practice of the Clairvaux scriptorium, where the new two-column layout was adopted much later than elsewhere.   \n",

      "level9\t ------------------The use of a large script in a small book is quite surprising, both because of the great waste of parchment, which was a very expensive material indeed, and because the small amount of text on every page obliged the reader to turn the pages frequently and touch the manuscript a great deal, thereby increasing its wear. The Cistercian breviary from Clairvaux copied in the thirteenth century was still in Clairvaux in 1472 when Abbot Pierre de Virey prepared a catalogue of the library’s books (it was identified by André Vernet as item Z 52 in this cata-logue).\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------31\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ A short description of the volume is followed by the words ‘ad usum infirmarie’ (‘for use in the infirmary’). Even if the reference to the infirmary is from the fifteenth century, the manuscript was probably still copied for this purpose. The reason for this uneconomic choice is that the book was meant to be used in the monastery’s infirmary. Speculating that sick (or merely elderly) monks would not have been able to read a small script, we could infer that this breviary was intended for those monks unable to take part in the Community Office who were supposed to recite a shortened version of it alone. A manuscript’s layout reflects various aspects concerning its readability and the ability to find specific texts in it quickly. Scribes used three main devic-es to help readers get their bearings on a page: a hierarchy of decorated initials for some types of texts, for instance, plus the use of distinctive kinds of script, such as capitals or uncial letters, and the use of different colours, mainly red for the rubrics, but blue and gold as well. Paris, BnF, Latin 9438, a sacramentary written in the middle of the ninth century for Drogon, bishop of Metz, displays an initial for every prayer, for example, but uses a bigger initial for the collect, the first prayer of each Mass. This was actually a strategy to help the reader find the beginning of each liturgical day. Prayers are introduced here by a title writ-ten in uncial gold letters. Letters of this kind were also used for initials and the \n",

Using different colours was certainly an effective way of creating a hierar-chy of importance and presenting a page in a pleasing manner. The calendar contained in Paris, Bibliothèque de l’Arsenal, 602 from the Dominican convent of Poissy uses gold ink for the major feasts, like the dedication of the church, St Dominic and Christmas, blue for other feasts marked as totum duplex, like John the Baptist, Mary Magdalene and Augustine, red for the feast duplex and semiduplex and brown ink for the minor feasts. Colours mark a precise structure here. In other cases, though, the correspondence between a colour and the im-portance of a feast is not a consistent one; sometimes colours were just used to create a chromatic variation of no significance at all. In the Salisbury calendar in Paris, BnF, NAL 2628, for example, certain major feasts are written in capital letters in two alternating colours, while other feasts are written in gold, blue, green and red without assigning a specific colour to a particular kind of feast. The layout of liturgical manuscripts is problematic to the extent that several different elements needed to be arranged on the same page in a coherent man-ner: the text, the decoration and, in certain cases, the musical notation. These three elements coexisted in a more or less harmonious way: they were added at different stages of copying a book and sometimes there was a gap between what was planned at the beginning and how the manuscript actually turned out in the end. The Exultet rolls from southern Italy are a striking example of the diffi-cult ‘cohabitation’ of different elements in the same written space, as their illus-tration is inverted in relation to the script and notation.\n",

This was possible as long as the notation did not need much space and the neumes did not reflect the distance between mu-sical pitches. However, problems with aligning arose when the musical notation evolved from the ‘in campo aperto’ type to the staff notation. The transition is evident in a few manuscripts, which show the scribe’s hesitation in placing the notation on the page properly. In an Italian missal from the twelfth century (Bologna, Biblioteca Universitaria, 2679), the scribe did not respect the dry point lines traced for the text when he was copying the notation and used three dry \n",

Notations did not evolve in the same way across Europe; some of them re-mained staffless, while others began to be copied on one or more lines. In the Gaillac gradual (Paris, BnF, Latin 776), the notation is copied on one dry point line; the ruling of the page has been traced regularly and the lines are the same distance apart, but one of them is used for the text and another for the notation. In this case, the scribe (or whoever prepared the page) did not have to distin-guish which lines were used for the text and which ones for the music. The notation gradually evolved into a more complex system needing up to four lines. In Modena, Biblioteca Capitolare, O.I.16, a Kyriale from the twelfth century, the notation is written on four dry point lines partially coloured in yellow and red and at the same distance apart. In a more sophisticated layout, the text occupies a larger space than the area between each line of the musical staff. This solution called for more complex and careful planning of the page, where the space had to be organised according to the specific content of the book. The system required a different procedure in pricking and ruling the page, as shown in Bergamo, Biblioteca Civica Angelo Mai, MA 150: the pricking for the text lines is shifted towards the edge of the page with respect to the notation, and the space required for the text is larger than that assigned to the lines of the staves. All these examples show how liturgical practice is at the intersection of knowledge and ‘know-how’ regarding the ceremonies themselves, the use and the destination of books and, of course, the specific copying strategies that were implemented in each scriptorium or atelier. What hides behind a liturgical book is a universe of rites, people, objects and texts that contributed to the construc-tion of a habit and tradition and that forms the identity of a community and a society as a whole. Liturgical practice is, in fact, a social practice, no matter whether it involves a ritual action, a sacrament, the use of a liturgical book or its transformation and adaptation. Liturgy had an impact outside liturgical practic-es in medieval times, involving all layers of society, and, since it is not a random practice but a reiterated and consistent one, it formed a frame of reference that was the foundation of intellectual activities, exegetical methods, scientific pro-cedures and artistic production. At the same time, liturgical practice impacted its own forms and contents, as it shaped and transformed the size and form of books, their content and the way they were produced. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------Abstract: Having the Actor-Network-Theory (ANT) developed by Bruno Latour in mind, I explore the fecundity of an approach considering manuscripts as actors on the stage through three contrasted case studies from the medieval Latin tradition. Firstly I examine the metaphor of the open book in the Dies irae, a famous late medieval liturgical poem. The central section investigates how the authority of Pope Gregory I is embedded into liturgical books and how this au-thority is transferred to later periods, especially through Ekkehard IV of St Gall in his continuation of the Casus sancti Galli. Finally the most spectacular case of a manuscript acting in a ritual performance is that of the ninth-century Pürten Gospels re-used as a miraculous therapeutic instrument. \n",
      "level4\t --------1 Introduction \n",
      "level9\t ------------------In search of a comparative perspective on ritual uses of handwritten books with-in a fundamentally cross-cultural horizon, this paper will use the Actor-Network-Theory (ANT), developed by the Paris-based scholar Bruno Latour and others in the 1980s.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------1\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ It seems indeed tempting to extend ANT’s fundamental caveat on behalf of subject-object dichotomies into a field such as manuscript culture(s), in this case with a specific focus on European material. As Beth Wil-liamson put it in her seminal reflections on pre-modern material culture as a whole: ‘Rather than thinking only of what people do with objects, we need also to think of how objects do things to and with people’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------2\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ In what follows, I would like to demonstrate the utility of such a change of perspective by presenting three case studies on ritual use of manuscripts in the context of Western Latin tradition – a choice which is clearly selective and culturally biased, as well as being inevitably conditioned (and limited) by my disciplinary competences. I do hope, however, that these examples will offer a potentiality of translation into other fields, to stimulate reflection and discussion not only on possible analo-gies but also – and probably even more so – on differences and even alterity. \n",

      "level9\t ------------------My first example, instead of dealing with a materially existing manuscript, re-fers to the literary narrative as an object. Its subject is a book celebrated in one of the most popular late medieval liturgical poems: the famous sequence Dies irae (‘Day of Wrath’), widely disseminated as part of the Mass of the Dead from the thirteenth century onwards:\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------3\n",

      "level12\t ------------------------4\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The origin of the piece, attributed for a long time to the Franciscan friar Tommaso da Celano (d. 1260), still remains a riddle.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------5\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Yet this did not, by any means, affect its im-pressive longevity – the sequence notably survived the almost complete exter-mination of this liturgical genre in the wake of the Tridentine Council\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------6\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ – and its far-reaching cultural appeal to this day. The array of musical settings of the text within the long tradition of European Requiem composition is more than im-pressive, and the same holds true for the almost countless evidence of textual or musical quotation, ranging from the Cathedral scene of Goethe’s Faust right up to Howard Shore’s score for The Lord of the Rings. In this paper, my intention is obviously not to deal with the career of the Dies irae but rather with some of its textual aspects, in particular with the fifth strophe which is conspicuously marked by bookish connotations: ‘Liber scrip-tus proferetur / in quo totum continetur / unde mundus iudicetur’ (‘A written book shall be brought forward, which contains everything and from which the world shall be judged’).\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------7\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ First, two short preliminary clarifications: (1) This part of the text, like the whole sequence, refers to the Last Judgement as a unique event intended to close and suspend history, as it were, and therefore lacking an essential aspect of rituality, which is repetition. Nevertheless, this eschatological projection is obviously modelled on patterns of long-established juridical practices.

As with many other examples of medieval liturgical poetry, the sequence shows obvious evidence of a strategy of authorization by means of biblical ref-erences.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------8\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ For the general scenario of the ‘Day of Wrath’, the poet’s major inspi-ration seems to be Zephaniah 1:14\n",

      "level9\t ------------------18.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------9\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ But, at least to some extent, he might equally have considered the established tradition of biblical commenting, as the very beginning of the verse under scrutiny – ‘liber scriptus proferetur’ – seems to reveal. The theme of the book is absent in Zephania, nor does the prophet use the verb proferre. I would like to suggest Jerome’s commentary on the minor prophets as a reference, for he has both elements, even presenting them in an inspiring conjunction. Conflating the Zephaniah text with the mention of the book in similar eschatological contexts (notably Apocalypse 20:12), Jerome presents the day of the Lord’s final judgement as the day ‘of the opening of the book’ (‘aperiendi libri’) and hence of the ‘disclosure of everybody’s conscience’ (‘pandendae conscientiae singulorum’) where ‘all the pomp and shadow of former crimes and vices and of a life of luxury are brought to light amidst the assembly’ (‘et omnis pompa et imago antiquorum scelerum et vitiorum atque luxuriae proferetur in medium’) (Fig. 1).\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------10\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Whereas in Jerome, proferetur with its important connotation of public promulgation refers to the sins listed within the liber, and hence to its contents, the Dies irae links the verb to the book itself, making it act as the true protago-nist. This scenario is underscored by the last member of the strophe, ‘unde mundus iudicetur’ (‘[from the book] the world will be judged’), and is further reinforced by a simple but highly effective exploitation of a typical feature of the sequence’s formal structure with its couplet-like textual and musical parallelism between two subunits (Fig. 2).\n",

Rädle 1987 and Stock 2002. 9 The sequence’s beginning (‘Dies irae dies illa’) can be found verbatim in v. 15 of the Zepha-nia text, where we also have the tuba (v. 16), which offers the exact model. For the remarkable poetical potential of the biblical text itself, cf. Irsigler 1977. 10 Jerome, Commentarium in Sophoniam, ed. Adriaen 1970, ll. 399–405. 11 Prose phrases in the first period of the genre, from around 1100, with increasingly rhythmi-cal verses additionally structured (as in this case) by internal end-rhyme.

      "level9\t ------------------The analogous positioning of liber and iudex at the opening of the paired versi-cles, combined with an identical melodic shaping, enhances their semantic relation within the musical performance itself: the agency of the book repre-sents that of the judge! But there is more. Following Jerome’s example, the author of the sequence mobilizes a biblical background reaching beyond the Old Testament prophet. The phrase ‘liber scriptus’ evidently goes back to Apocalypse 5:1: ‘Et vidi in dextera sedentis super thronum librum scriptum intus et foris signatum sigillis septem’ (‘And I saw on the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne a book written inside and outside and sealed with seven seals’). This reference not only confirms the intimate nexus between book and judge, but equally leads to a better understanding of the somewhat puzzling phrase ‘liber scriptus’. Far from just indicating a handwritten book, and thus being a somewhat tautologi-cal expression (in the thirteenth century a book could but be manuscript), the \n",

      "level8\t ----------------–\n",
      "level9\t ------------------10: ‘Et vidi et ecce manus missa ad me in qua erat involutus liber et expandit illum coram me qui erat scriptus intus et foris et scriptae erant in eo lamentationes et carmen et vae’ (‘Then I looked, and behold, a hand was extended to me, and a scroll was in it.

      "level12\t ------------------------12\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ A glance at the material aspects of the libri mentioned is not devoid of inter-est here: Ezekiel’s ‘involutus liber’ is of course a scroll and the same holds true for the Apocalypse, whereas medieval readers of these texts would tend to asso-ciate them with the idea of a codex, as illustrations in numerous manuscripts actually show. Now, ‘scriptus intus et foris’, while thinking of a scroll, simply means that it had writing on both of its sides, which was rather unusual. The biblical phrase is thus primarily meant to indicate the fullness of the message of the mysterious book in question: the entire body of God’s revelation to men that could not be contained by the material capacity of an ordinary book.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------13\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ That is also Bede’s interpretation in his influential commentary on the Apocalypse. According to him, the ‘Liber scriptus intus et foris’ stands for the Holy Scripture meant to contain the totality of knowledge about salvation: the Old Testament being written outside and the New Testament, as the visible fulfilment of the Old, inside.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------14\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Given the fondness of allegorical thinking within patristic and medieval exegetic traditions, the growing influence of a re-reading of this inter-pretation in the sense of multi-layered semantics has nothing of a surprise. This is already the case with the seminal interpretation by Gregory the Great in his homilies on Ezekiel, where he distinguishes between outside and inside as rep-resenting the literal versus the spiritual understanding of Holy Scripture.\n",

      "level9\t ------------------Still, the accent is different.

      "level9\t ------------------It is conspicuous that this amazing text, which also marks pictorial representa-tions of the eschatological judgement from medieval manuscript illuminations, resonates at this point of the sequence. If one follows Hans Blumenberg’s fasci-nating discussion of Western metaphors on books and reading, in his Legibility of the World, this biblical model reflects a typical scenario of a juridical process where the judge relies on two different species of reference books for his sen-tence: the legal code – Augustine in his City of God proposed to understand the many books of Apocalypse 20 as those of the biblical Old and New Testament, functioning as a mandatory moral compass\n",

Apocalypse 5:1 further enhances the auratic status of the ‘Liber scriptus’ while insisting on its strongly arcane nature by presenting the book as being ‘sealed with seven seals’ (‘signatum sigillis septem’). This is another significant mystification of the book which, although immediately following the phrase ‘intus et foris’, is again omitted by the poet, despite the broadly attested medie-val iconographic tradition of this remarkable feature.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------18\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ Switching to the commentary tradition, it is interesting to go back again to Augustine, who makes a particularly interesting point while dealing with the almost surreal concept of a single book containing the entirety of all deeds of mankind: \n",

      "level9\t ------------------As Augustine’s conclusion is hardly compatible with the biblical text compel-ling us to think of just one single book, he no doubt has to call on a sort of mi-raculous divine power to solve the conundrum. However, speaking in such a ‘physical’ way (carnaliter in Augustin’s terms) of a book of incommensurable size and ponderousness might have substantially contributed to the ‘imaginary’ tradition of the eschatological Liber vitae up to such suggestive representations as William Blake’s design The Day of Judgement of 1805 (Fig. 3). \n",

Some exceptionally decorated examples such as the confraternity book of the church of Durham with its names written through-out in gold and silver ink seems even to lay claim to a material emulation of the heavenly reference they are foreshadowing. To briefly sum up this first part: the ‘liber scriptus’ of the Dies irae is defi-nitely more than just an object.

      "level12\t ------------------------53\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ The strategy seems obvious: Ekkehard, trying to produce a pro domo re-writing of the narrative that Johannes Diaconus had drafted a century and a half before him, bridged his re-writing on one of the two cantores sent from Rome – to which he gave a (programmatic) name, Romanus – and on a set of manu-scripts: Gregory’s ‘antiphonarius authenticus’ allegedly preserved in Rome, and the Cantatorium at St Gall as its transalpine counterfort. It is interesting though to observe a slight but important difference when comparing the aforemen-tioned notice he entered in the St Gall manuscript of the Vita sancti Gregorii, with the version of the same story in the Casus. In the notice of St Gall, Stiftsbib-liothek St. Gallen, Cod. 578 (see above) a third book is edged in between the two piers, for here, interestingly enough, Ekkehard has the St Gall copy enthroned on the repository by Romanus ‘copied from his own transcript’ (‘e suo exempla-tum’). Ekkehard might have been aware of the Cantatorium as a codex written by St Gall scribes in a style he was familiar with, and would therefore have known that it was not a Roman book. In the more literary context of the Casus, however, he condensed his narrative rather effectively in view of a two-step rhythm with the Roman original and the book Romanus had brought from Rome (‘quem ipse attulit’) to represent the Roman original at St Gall. While this trick highlights Ekkehard’s skills as a storyteller, the scenario of ‘Phantoms of Re-membrance’ (with a nod at Patrick Geary’s felicitous formula) is garnished by a thoroughly material element: the ivories on the front cover of the manuscript! Where did these spolia come from and when did they travel to St Gall? To quote Anton von Euw: ‘Es gibt eigentlich nur eine sinnvolle Erklärung, nämlich, dass sie schon Bestandteil der Hülle jenes Antiphonars (Cantatorium) waren, von dem Cod. 359 im 10.

However, this addition (‘Sed et piissimus imperator cantorem illum sibi allectum, Petrum quidem nomine, sancti Galli cenobio immorari aliquantisper iusserat. Illic enim et cantarium sicut hodie est cum autentico antiphonario locans Romani cantare et discere […] iussit’) was again affected by the already discussed misunderstanding, as the scribe had the Gregorian authenticum located in St Gall instead of Rome!

The ivories of the former book’s binding would then have been re-used to clothe the St Gall copy, staging it as a tangible pledge of its venerable geneal-ogy as a ‘Roman’ book, as it were, and thus acting as a warranty of conformity with pristine Roman tradition. Moreover, and this is a really salient point, the ivories were also meant to authorize an unheard of element, which the Monza Cantatorium for example did not contain: the musical notation that the book crafted north of the Alps consistently contained; hence, not only the textual but even the musical aspect of the ‘Gregorian’ repertory comes into play. Literary and material aspects thus converge to make the Cantatorium an emblematical symbol of the abbey’s claim to Romanitas.

Dealing with the issue of specific uses of codices, in this case in the context of rituality, we are regularly confronted with shifts between original and secondary functions, either in the sense of a succession of use and re-use, with the latter replacing the former, or of an overlapping of different ‘vocations’ of one and the same artefact. Obviously, this kind of ‘re-coding’ is a rather common phenomenon in the field of manuscripts originally destined to be used ritually. Magical (re-)using of ‘holy books’ is widely attested in pre-modern times, including protective and apotropaic contexts, but also healing practices as well as prognostics, ordeals and the like, as attested by an impres-sive body of evidence, presented at the 1999 Münster conference on Pragma-tische Dimensionen mittelalterlicher Schriftkultur by Klaus Schreiner.\n",

The pages close to those with the representations of the evangelists are conspicuously marked by the stress of the procedure described by Cronberger, showing stains and tears, while the miniatures themselves are in an absolutely deplorable state (Fig. 9): Luke is almost completely destroyed, and John was replaced by a surrogate in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century.\n",

There is however no doubt whatsoever that the general tradition of attrib-uting thaumaturgical qualities to Gospel books can already be found in much earlier times. For instance, in a passage of the seventh of Augustine’s homilies on the Gospel of John, dealing with remorse and penitence as spiritual remedies offered by God to sinners, the author inserted a short digression on practices of treating bodily ailments – a headache in this case – by means of the physical application of Gospel manuscripts: \n",

      "level9\t ------------------ In this chapter on the Pürten book, I have deliberately tried to refrain from assessing the recycling of sacred books, in this case of a Gospel, in categories of theological ‘correctness’ versus ‘misuse’, as another question seems to be his-torically more meaningful and hence more interesting: to what extent do such cases of re-coding actualize potentials already latent in what we might call the original status of such artefacts? For the Pürten book, for example, it is not without interest to look back to the Ordo Romanus I as a fundamental referential frame for the liturgical use of the Gospel book. Whereas in the solemn reading it obviously realizes its true vocation, in the ritual choreography which frames this moment it mostly acts as a closed book, staged and venerated as a ‘bodily’ representation of Christ. Hence, use of the textus evangelii as an instrument of healing as attested not only in Pürten but elsewhere and much earlier as well, instead of being criticized as a surprising or even scandalizing practice, might be considered as nothing other than an attempt to re-read the very old and ven-erable theologoumenon of Christus Medicus, albeit with a thoroughly somatic understanding of a fundamentally spiritually accentuated concept!\n",

      "level9\t ------------------Having used a term like ‘actor’ in my analysis of cultural relations and dynam-ics, it might be helpful – coming back to Latour for a moment – to ‘reactivate the metaphors implied in the word’, remembering thus ‘that this expression, like that of “person”, comes from the stage’. This means that ‘far from indicating a pure and unproblematic source of action, they both lead to puzzles as old as the institution of theatre itself’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------93\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ In the three case studies presented in this paper, manuscripts are more than just objects, they appear as actors entering the stage, even – and perhaps most prominently – in the remarkable case of a phantomatic book such as the ‘Liber scriptus’ dominating the eschatological scenario of the ‘Day of Wrath’. Still, their status remains to some extent unfathomable, and if Latour rightly insists on what he terms the dislocation of action per se being ‘borrowed, distributed, \n",

      "level12\t ------------------------94\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ this seems especially true for the agency of manuscripts destined to be used within the complex and multi-layered field of ritual. Neither a consideration of books simply as ‘raw matter’ brought to life by human action, nor an undifferentiated glorification of bookish materiality would be helpful here. To be sure, books, especially manu-scripts with their individual figuration, are perceived as actors in pre-modern times, and presumably – to use Beth Williamson’s felicitous formula – they still are doing things ‘to and with people’,\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------95\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ if only in a metonymical understanding. Yet, and this is an important qualification, their agency must not be considered independently from that of humans: they are not operating instead of humans, but as part of a network of actors, mediators and intermediaries, including ‘many metaphysical shades between full causality and sheer inexistence’.\n",
      "level12\t ------------------------96\n",
      "level9\t ------------------ That is why it is important to recall once again the synergy between books and their human ‘partners’, repeatedly emphasized in the course of this investigation. One question still remains though: what makes manuscripts and above all ritually used manuscripts particularly idoneous to assume such a role? It seems to me that this aptitude is due an interaction of different yet related aspects: 1. The fundamentally incarnational nature of Christianity as a religion anchored in the central tenet of God ‘materializing’ himself while becoming flesh. 2. The substantial role of ‘physicality’ within medieval religion and devotion.\n",

The ‘medial’ authority of the (pre-modern) codex with its aura of unique-ness and – especially in the realm of the sacred – of outstanding artistic quality and material preciousness. While modern scholars in their search for historical and philological infor-mation are mostly looking at medieval manuscripts as containers of texts (in a very broad sense of the term of course), anthropologists would insist on the necessity to challenge this kind of ‘text-centred’ methodology. Beyond the text is the symptomatic title of a seminal study published in 1987 by the American scholar Lawrence A. Hoffman, on Jewish ritual tradition.\n",

This could be a meaningful step towards an increasing awareness of the specific medial agency of these artefacts, including their po-tential for being re-contextualized and re-coded, hence leading to a better un-derstanding of texts as living entities. \n",

Samuel Gessner is an assistant researcher at the Interuniversity Center for the History of Sci-ence and Technology (CIUHCT) and guest professor at the Department of History and Philoso-phy of Science at the Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal. His research focuses on the diverse mathematical cultures that existed in medieval and early modern Europe. He examines how they interacted by studying the role of mathematical and astronomical instruments conceived by theoreticians and practitioners. He emphasises the need to use artefacts of material culture as primary sources alongside textual documents, particularly mathematical and astronomical instruments. Felix Heinzer, former curator of manuscripts at the Württembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart (1988–2005), retired as professor of Medieval Latin at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg in 2015.
