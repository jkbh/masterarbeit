      "Some Babylonian temple astronomers apparently used their predictions to produce horoscopes for private citizens.45 Since the fate of the newborn was not usually written down along with the horoscope, this information must have been communicated in a private consultation.",

      "First, the forms of Divine Office during the Middle Ages are briefly presented.",
      "Secondly, the author reflects on the nature and use of a portable breviary, using the late-fifteenth-century manuscript from the abbey of San Zeno Maggiore in Verona, Kremsm\u00fcnster, Stiftsbibliothek, CC60.",
      "The particular nature and form in which this breviary is used is analysed by comparing its format, layout, and contents to other types of liturgical books.",
      "The author then concludes by underlining how portable breviaries, like the one presented here, could be considered liturgical as well as devotional: they were used privately, but also reflected the liturgical forms and contents of the community in which they were embedded."

      "Medieval music historians, for instance, are often interested in the process in which melodies first became fixed in writing;1 historians of liturgy are frequently concerned with the origins and early forms of Christian rites and rituals;2 literary historians mostly ask when a text came into being and by whom it was written.",
      "However, in this paper I would like to start at an end: I will begin at the end of the process leading to the unification of many liturgical books in the Middle Ages that had previously been used by different ritual actors into one single book manufactured for a single person to use.",

      "Firstly, using this breviary and, in particular, its transmission of the office for Saint Zeno, I will initially trace back some of the liturgical book types that preceded the breviary genealogically, and compare them to the breviary.",

In the case of the late medieval breviary from the abbey of San Zeno Maggiore, the analysis revealed that the manuscript can be categorized as a portable breviary and it contains all liturgical material for the celebration of the Divine Office. Additionally, it is evident that this material had not only been fitted into the smallest space possible, but was also transmitted without musical notation, and its contents had been, in some cases, heavily abbreviated. Still, the two following important questions remain unanswered: \u2018Who used this artefact?\u2019 and: \u2018How did he or she use it?\u2019 Luckily, a number of liturgical materials recorded in the book can deliver an answer to at least the first of these questions. Firstly, on fols 14\u201319, a series of so-called ordines can be found. An ordo describes and regulates how special rituals should be performed. The breviary from San Zeno Maggiore contains ordines for monastic rites usually performed by the abbot, for instance one for the ordaining of a monk (\u2018ordo ad faciendum monachum\u2019) and one describing how to welcome guests or pilgrims (\u2018ordo ad suscipiendum hospites seu peregrinos in porta monasterii\u2019). Also, an ordo containing instructions on how to bless the monks\u2019 refectory is transmitted in the codex and corresponds with a text used particularly in the southern German abbey of Tegernsee in Bavaria. It will be necessary to come back to this point further on in the article. Secondly, on fol. 90r, the manuscript records a series of so-called absolutions, blessings. The abbot pronounced a blessing at the end of every hour during his office.20 In this manuscript, the blessings are ordered following the hour of prayer during which they were delivered. Thus, they are introduced by rubrics like: \u2018In primo nocturno absolutio\u2019, \u2018In secundo nocturno absolutio\u2019, etc. The fact that the breviary transmits texts decidedly pertinent to the abbot reveals quite clearly that the book was intended for no less than the abbot of San Zeno Maggiore. The small codex supplied him with everything he needed to perform not only the daily office (e.g. the blessings for all hours of prayer), but also for a series of special rituals that were not performed daily (e.g. ordaining a brother-monk or the blessing of the monastery\u2019s living spaces)."

Since the beginning of the fifteenth century, around 1427, new monks had been called from Germany, and probably Tegernsee, to populate the abbey of San Zeno Maggiore.21 However, a series of external abbots, not chosen among the monks of the abbey, were also put in charge of the institution.22 These German monks were installed to restore the Benedictine way of life into the monastery. They did this and other things by acquiring new manuscripts for the monastery library and substituting the obsolete liturgical books with new ones. Some of these books were also aesthetically more to their taste, since they had hired German illuminators to decorate them.23 The arrival of these German monks in San Zeno could also explain why some of the ordines in our breviary record southern German customs."

Our breviary could not only give him an overview of the liturgical customs of the monastery he was to lead, but also, due to its small size, enable him to celebrate the Divine Office anywhere he wanted. To fulfil his administrative duties, the abbot was often unable to celebrate with his brothers in the choir. Not only did he often have to travel, he also even lived separated from the brothers in his private habitation when he was in the abbey. With this portable breviary, he could celebrate the office privately and also when travelling. Thus, this breviary was with regards to its format, layout, contents and function both a liturgical and a devotional book: it was, for its owner and carrier, a private book that contained the rituals that only he, the abbot, would need. But since it reflected the liturgical customs of the monastic community that the abbot directed, it also was a liturgical book. Thus, this breviary is a devotional book in the sense that it could be used for the private recitation of the office. However, it was also a liturgical book because, since its owner and user was an abbot, it contained the liturgical materials of his monastic community."

Instead, the words had to be pronounced loudly and possibly tractim, which means with the right pauses, neither too slow nor too fast, so that they were easily comprehensible: Private recitation in a low voice was known as reading done privatim, secreto, tacite or in silentio. Yet, since it was vocal, these terms occur with legere as well as cantare. Private diction of the Office, of psalms, prayers, and the private celebration of Mass still could not be compared with the reading of, say, a theological treatise or a poem.

I examine how these representations appear in manuscripts and editions of these texts. I also reflect on the material objects on which and with which these multiplications may have been performed.

Answering these questions directly may not be possible.

Furthermore, the commentaries on these oral treatises are often explicitly written (likh-) texts. They too can contain quoted verses and staged dialogs. Finally, whether we are looking at South Asian language manuscripts in general or manuscripts dealing with mathematical and astral texts in these languages, quite famously, we are overwhelmed by the sheer number of documents.7 These manuscripts are quite recent and made of fragile bark, palm leaf and paper \u2013 an abundance which suggests, in part, that transmission also involved hand copying texts. The oral performance of an astronomical or mathematical treatise thus seems to have been a standard rhetoric for the presentation of scholarly knowledge; a mise-en-sc\u00e8ne of how ideally scholarly knowledge should be performed and transmitted without necessarily being the reality of how the text was actually passed down (in writing rather than through oral transmission?) or stored (in writing rather than in a person\u2019s mind?).8 This paradox of our sources and our historiographic difficulties in treating them also indicates how little we know of the contexts in which astronomical and mathematical texts in Sanskrit were composed, studied, learned, performed and copied. In the case of Sanskrit mathematical texts, the context is often thought to be that of a school, or at least of a teacher and student relationship.9 Another possible imagined setting, from what we know of early modern literature and miniatures, is a royal court with its courtly performances and rivalries, which might echo into more rural settings in temples or on village stages.10 Finally, the vigorous debate forums of what would have been a South Asian public sphere from the eighteenth century onwards, probably also fuelled imagination on the public performance of Sanskrit mathematical texts and procedures.11"

The same term can be used to evoke both the procedure itself and the resolution of a problem. Consequently, operations appear as the elementary building blocks from which algorithms are made. They are very literally perifabrications (parikarman). Other words can be used of course, some evoking methods which lead (ny\u0101ya) to a fruit/result (phala). Therefore, the execution of the algorithm and the algorithm are one and a same thing in the vocabulary. In theatre and dance, according to Sanskrit texts, if a performance is related to action (k\u1e5b-) the performance itself has a separate name and verb (na\u1e6d-). We do not find such distinctions in the resolution of problems or the execution of algorithms. However, texts that were not theatre plays but had a scholarly dimension could be associated with some kind of performance, chanting intertwined with near theatrical staging, or recitation with improvisation, possibly in Sanskrit and vernacular. This is notably the case of the historical law texts called \u2018the ancient\u2019 (pur\u0101\u1e47a), which were performed by specialists, paura\u1e47ikas.19 We can thus imagine that similarly astral texts or mathematical texts could be performed by the specialists of these texts. Astrologers in South Asia today are known to intertwine computations in what is sometimes a ritual performance. Such ritual performances might include the recitation of texts.20 To evaluate whether they existed in the past, and in what form, we would need to document such stagings in non-mathematical and non-astral literature as well."

Text by text we should try to assess which elements may invite us to think that this is the case. In all instances, choices are made in the treatises as in the commentaries on which part of the performance is shown. Each mathematical commentary has its own way of relating to the different performances that the resolution of a problem entails. A text can never faithfully describe and/or represent the whole set of performances attached to the resolution of a problem, since these include non-discursive acts. They however necessarily give a point of view on it. More precisely, a treatise\u2019s rules give a point of view on the steps of the procedure, while the commentary expounds on what is deemed necessary about it.21 In what follows, the intention of the texts in relation to the performance of the algorithm by a reader or hearer will not be discussed directly. However, we will have to touch on such an intention as we try to reconstruct the performance of a multiplication. We will see how discussing the performance in relation to the text helps us perceive what could have been some aspect of the author\u2019s aim. We will consider the texts as more or less willing testimonies to how a given algorithm or operation was carried out, and we will use texts as the tools we have as historians to reconstruct these executions.

Colebrooke 1817, 319, reads \u2018cow\u2019s string\u2019 (go-s\u016btrik\u0101) and Hayashi 2017 has recently agreed to follow him on this as this reading corresponds to what is noted in available manuscripts of the treatise and commentary. Sudh\u0101kara Dvivedin\u2019s text, as well as Bibhutibhusan Datta and Narayan Avadesh Singh\u2019s interpretation, suggest a different reading, go-m\u016btrik\u0101. Datta and Singh 1935, 147, n. 4, evoke live oral traditions through \u2018pa\u1e47\u1e0dits\u2019, to justify their reading. The transition from the devanagar\u012b \u092e (ma) to \u0938 (sa) is indeed very slight and could explain the corruption of the text here. The expression go-m\u016btrik\u0101 means lit. \u2018cow\u2019s urine\u2019 and is a common word used to signify \u2018zig-zag\u2019. Takao Hayashi argues that there is another kind of multiplication that is standardly called go-m\u016btrik\u0101 and which indeed corresponds to a zig-zag; while the \u2018cow\u2019s string\u2019, which could attach several cows in a row together, may correspond better to what is described of the display. This argument however is also debatable. First, because a same name could be used to denote different multiplication executions as shown in Hayashi 2017, 58\u201359 and in Keller and Morice-Singh 2022. Second, although attested in dictionary entries such as the one authored by Monier Monier-Williams, the existence and use of such strings (or of such an expression) needs to be documented. Nevertheless, since the image of three cows in a diagonal row is a plausible one for this multiplication method, and since it further retains the manuscript readings, we will adopt this name for the time being."

Multiplying with a multiplier subdivided into \u2018portions\u2019 (kha\u1e47\u1e0da) means, according to P\u1e5bth\u016bdaka, splitting the multiplier according to its different powers of ten. This method then depends on the fact that counting uses base ten and that multiplication is distributive over addition. P\u1e5bth\u016bdaka considers the example 235 \u00d7 288. In the commentary, 288 is the multiplier and 235 the multiplicand. He will compute 235 \u00d7 288 = 235 (2.102 + 8.101 + 8.100) = 470.102 + 1880.101 + 1880.100 = 67680.

There are reasons to believe that in the original text by P\u1e5bth\u016bdhaka, representations of the working surface concerned a medium different from the one on which permanent text was written. P\u1e5bth\u016bdhaka and the author he comments upon, Brahmagupta, both refer to \u2018dust computations\u2019 (dh\u016blikarman), suggesting that computations were performed either on a dust board, or simply on the bare ground; not on a palm leaf or bark on which manuscripts would have been inscribed in his lifetime.28 But why then would the multiplier, on the other hand, be included in the text? Could this indicate that for those who copied the manuscripts in the late eighteenth century and onwards, the idea of a separate working surface represented an antiquated form and that in more modern times computations were usually integrated within the text itself? This is a hypothetical historical interpretation, but we might also be misled by thinking about material tools of computation. Perhaps that which is in a capsule represents computations to be committed to memory? We cannot answer these questions, of course, but they do show however that what is represented by encapsulated numerical tables remains undetermined, open to interpretation. Possibly, over time, for different authors and scribes it represented different things."

      "In discussing the extent of their use, however, it is difficult to assess the number of music rolls in circulation in the late Middle Ages.",

      "It turns out that most of the several hundred astronomical manuscripts produced and assembled during the fifteenth century and extant in patrimonial libraries are \u2018toolbox manuscripts\u2019, as described in recent scholarship.2 These typically consist of texts, numerical tables, diagrams and volvelles (moveable diagrams featuring rotatable parchment discs and threads).",

      "While this is the reason why modern scholarship included the word \u2018Parisian\u2019 in the title of this table set, astronomers in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were mostly referring to this work with expressions like \u2018the tables of King Alfonso\u2019.",
      "This points to a second essential historical fact about this table set: the elements originate in AlAndalus and more specifically from the work patronised by King Alfonso X in the later part of the thirteenth century.14 The exact content of the Parisian Alfonsine Tables is subject to variations from one witness to another.",
      "It seems clear, however, that the tables pertaining to the topics of chronology, motions of the eighth sphere, and planetary motions are core elements."

      "With regard to Byzantine Gospel books from the seventh and eighth century, Gerard Rouwhorst remarked: \u2018The main problem is that the Greek biblical manuscripts that date from this period do not contain any paratextual information concerning the liturgical functions these manuscripts might have fulfilled\u2019.28 Consequently, the liturgical use of these codices has often been negated completely, some scholars arguing that the codices were exclusively used as a ritual and material substitute for Jesus Christ in the liturgy that was incensed, kissed and put on the altar like on a throne.29 After analysing written sources for the Byzantine reading practice of the Gospel pericopes in the liturgy, Rouwhorst counters that lectio continua was the dominant way of proclaiming these passages in Eastern Christianity.",
      "Therefore this practice of reading the Gospels \u2018made liturgical instructions superfluous\u2019,30 as can also be assumed for Latin Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages.",
      "Thus the lack of paratextual instructions is not a clue about the nonliturgical embedding of the codices, but can be interpreted as a sign of a past reading practice and a hint of the liturgical use of the codices for the proclamation of the Gospel."

      "The list of the feast days on which this book was supposed to be used is therefore in close proximity to the textile bearing Gundis\u2019s name, which reminds the reader (the deacon or the celebrant of the Mass) to pray for her.",
      "The Gospel codices of Bamberg Cathedral may also have been used in accordance with the medieval teaching of memoria.",
      "In the Middle Ages, liturgical vessels and codices were donated in order to save the donor\u2019s soul after their death and benefices were installed to celebrate Masses for the redemption of the donor.",
      "Since it was believed that donated chalices, patens, altars and manuscripts especially unfolded their redeeming agency when they were used in the liturgy, it is likely that the use of precious manuscripts such as the Gundis Lectionary was not an exception, but rather the rule, at least on a few choice occasions during the liturgical year.31 The ritual use of the manuscripts, particularly the donated ones, therefore ensured the commemoration of the donors and brought them very close to the sacred space."

      "The famous Pericopes of Henry II (Clm 4452) contains several narrative miniatures depicting episodes from the life of Jesus Christ.",

      "These miniatures occur in the cycle of the liturgical year and follow the Temporale after Christmas and Epiphany, which have fixed calendar dates.",
      "The Temporale codifies the movable Christian feasts (Maundy Thursday, Easter, Assumption and Pentecost).",
      "Three further miniatures illustrate key events in the life of the saints (John the Baptist, Peter and Paul, and the Virgin Mary) and appear in the order given by the Sanctorale, which codifies feast days with fixed dates.",
      "One of these shows the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, which is based on the apocryphal texts of the Transitus Mariae, while the other two depict events that are described in the New Testament.",
      "There are two more narrative miniatures as well.",
      "The first one, showing the vocation of Zacchaeus the tax collector and the banquet in his house, follows the pericope for the dedication of the church (fol. 200r), and the second one, on the Resurrection of the Dead and the Last Judgement, uses a double page to illustrate the passage for the Requiem (fols 201v\u2013202r).",
      "Since these occasions are not associated with any specific dates or periods in the year, they do not belong to the Temporale or to the Sanctorale.",
      "The conception of this manuscript as a Gospel lectionary provided another way of highlighting pericopes for especially important feasts.",
      "Instead of containing the whole text of the four Gospels, the Pericopes of Henry II only contains 194 pericopes, which had to be proclaimed in the particular Masses during the liturgical year.39 Various pericopes were endowed with lavishly decorated initial pages, and sometimes even with title or incipit pages.",
      "The structure of this codex facilitated a particular mode of incorporating the miniatures: the first part of the Gospel lectionary with the Temporale and the fixed feasts relating to Jesus Christ exhibits a pictorial cycle that follows the chronology of the life of Jesus.",
      "The question of whether the distribution of miniatures can be attributed to the liturgy and to the pericopes that were \u2013 or were originally intended to be \u2013 proclaimed from this manuscript cannot be answered with any certainty.",
      "In fact, it is not even clear whether this codex was used in the liturgy at all, as there are neither obvious signs of use nor any recitation marks or later accentuations or supplements.",
      "Thus, the miniatures could also have served as an aid to finding the corresponding pericopes for the most significant occasions and feasts in the church year."

      "It is therefore conceivable that this manuscript was used on these days and was possibly carried through the church, displaying the colourful miniatures to the congregation in order to indicate the meaning and biblical background of the particular occasions.",

In losing its original syntactic function, the expression \u02bealb\u0101sihu za-mel\u0101t became the head of the sentence in the new context and, as a consequence, the possessive pronominal suffix -hu (\u2018his\u2019) which originally referred to Jesus Christ was reinterpreted as referring to the saint \u1e56an\u1e6dalewon.",

This reference not only confirms the intimate nexus between book and judge, but equally leads to a better understanding of the somewhat puzzling phrase \u2018liber scriptus\u2019.",

When He spread it out before me, it was written on the front and back, and written on it were lamentations, mourning and woe\u2019).12 A glance at the material aspects of the libri mentioned is not devoid of interest here: Ezekiel\u2019s \u2018involutus liber\u2019 is of course a scroll and the same holds true for the Apocalypse, whereas medieval readers of these texts would tend to associate them with the idea of a codex, as illustrations in numerous manuscripts actually show.",
      "Now, \u2018scriptus intus et foris\u2019, while thinking of a scroll, simply means that it had writing on both of its sides, which was rather unusual.",

      "This is already the case with the seminal interpretation by Gregory the Great in his homilies on Ezekiel, where he distinguishes between outside and inside as representing the literal versus the spiritual understanding of Holy Scripture.15 Interestingly enough, the author of the Dies irae seems to have in mind the first part of Bede\u2019s argument, for, while he abbreviates the biblical quote, he replac-"
