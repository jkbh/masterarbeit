AutoGPT is an open source project that tries to 'make GPT fully autonomous'. It started out as collection of loose scripts but quickly gained alot of interest in the open source community and grew into a much bigger and now funded project. Initally it only contained the AutoGPT agent that I will anaylse in this chapter but over time has seen additions such as a agent framework called \textit{forge}, a benchmarking system that was put in place to host an agent hackathon as well as branching out of the project to create the \textit{agent protocol}. The agent protocol is an attempt of the community to standardize agent applications.

The AutoGPT was not built with a focus on information retrieval, which is why I will analyse the information retrieval capabilites in this chapter.

GPT langauge models are used to control an agent that works towards reaching a stated goal. The project contains a core general purpose agent with a predefined set of abilities. Addidtionaly a baseline sdk is beeing developed to build custom agents.
