\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Contributions of this Thesis}
This thesis says ``Hello World!'', see also \cite{Kernighan1974}.
\section{Related Work}
There are many hello world programs.

\subsection{Transformer}
Transformer Netzwerke sind supertoll. Encoder-Decoder architecture gained traction as they allowed for the computation of better intermedate representation of the data.

\subsection{BERT}
Bert is the Ernie's best friend.

\subsection{Generative Pre-Trained Transformer}
I like GPT because ChatGPT is cool lets goooo.

\subsection{InstructGPT}
With InstructGPT OpenAI(lol) added some magic to the whole thingy. They gave people in nigeria below minimum wage and asked them to rate GPT outputs and trained a reward model that can fine-tune GPT according to human needs. They call this Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF).

Aligning language models is a central research area in creating intelligent systems that humans want to use. As baseline LLMs are training on huge datasets containing all kinds of text documents, the outputs are not necessarily tailored for the questioners needs.
Rather, they input sequence is simply continued with the most likily next tokens. InstructGPT are a family of LLMs created by OpenAI that are fine-tuned with human feedback. With this procedure the models are better at capturing the intent of the user. Furthermore there are improvements in hallucinations and false information.
\subsection{Information Retrieval Agents}
Information is cool and so is retrieving it. But that is hard, because most information is useless. As an example, watch any markus lanz episode.
\section{Structure of this Thesis}


In Chapter~\vref{chapter-main}, we say hello.

\label{chapter-main}
I don't know what I am going to do, but i know it's going to be fun siuuuuu.
\chapter{Conclusion}
Saying hello world is quite easy.
