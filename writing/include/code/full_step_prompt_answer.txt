             - Decide on the next step, whether it's concluding the task or seeking further clarification or details',
    'reasoning': 'The task required an understanding and explanation  of a specific aspect of the breviary, which is complex and likely requires specific knowledge not innately known. Therefore, leveraging the vector database to first retrieve context is aligned with the best practices outlined. Following that, using the `answer_with_context` ability ensures the answer is enriched and accurate based on the  sourced information.',
    'speak': "Using our resources, I've successfully provided an explanation of how chants and readings are differentiated in a breviary. The process involved retrieving context and then crafting an answer based on that context.',
    'text': "I've completed the task of explaining the performative distinction between chants and readings in the breviary using the provided resources. The first step involved retrieving relevant context from memory about the topic. The second step was answering the query with the help of the retrieved context.'
